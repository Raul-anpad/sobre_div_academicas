                                    The objectives of this theme aim to explore the link between Information Systems in
                                    Accounting, Auditing and Finance practices, as well as to develop a broader and more
                                    inclusive view of Blockchain disruptive potential and its value and to leverage new
                                    business strategies. Thus, we seek to contribute with discussions about the impact
                                    of Blockchain and other new technologies given the use of information and the
                                    decision-making process, promoting discussions related with structure, regulate,
                                    control and model processes in private and public organizations.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The transformations brought by new technologies have impact in business structures,
                                    creating opportunities as well as challenges for organizations. The greater data
                                    volume and the digital transformation of different processes help organizations to
                                    improve outcome and efficiency analysis. However, at the same time, organizations
                                    are under pressure to demonstrate greater transparency, with internal controls and
                                    information quality management to different stakeholders.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    At the same time, traditional aspects of management are being replaced with new
                                    forms of organizational practices and to new business models, implying constant
                                    structural changes. Regardless of these trends, many organizations are still finding
                                    a way to balance the improvement of their current operations with the new
                                    opportunities offered by emerging technologies.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    This context requires an interdisciplinary analysis regarding the opportunities and
                                    challenges, combining the technical-theoretical knowledge from professionals inside
                                    organizations’ compliance departments with the theoretical-empirical knowledge of
                                    the Information Systems professionals. Besides, the current context also demands
                                    professionals with analytical skills, trained to work with different technologies
                                    and their implications in the most diverse organizational processes.<br />

                                    The proposition of the theme “Technologies, Collaboration and health” is
                                    characterized as a necessary research trail in the area of ??Information
                                    Administration (ADI), in which studies and research related to the different
                                    environments of use, adoption and appropriation of IT, aspects characterizers and
                                    health effects. In addition, the theme aims to promote a space for dialogue in which
                                    the transformation of health through the use of Information and Communication
                                    Technologies is widely discussed, and can configure the current state of development
                                    of health information technology in Brazil and worldwide .<br />
                                    This is a theme that is constantly evolving, given that technologies such as
                                    Internet-based social platforms have favored collaboration, as well as sharing and
                                    interaction; and they are being appropriated in the dimensions of human activity in
                                    its most diverse contexts, including in the area of ??Health, with repercussions on
                                    the activities, roles and skills of health professionals and their peers. It is
                                    known that health is not restricted to its professionals and the government, the
                                    user of health services today has become the main core of the sector, and
                                    information and communication technologies allow digital services that meet the
                                    wishes and needs of these individuals. Topics such as digital, global health and
                                    mobility; clinical informatics; Organization, Management, Evaluation and Social
                                    Impact of Health Informatics are brought by the academic community since they are
                                    understood as an area of ??knowledge and practice, they are considered in the
                                    organizational health environments, which are influenced by the potential of digital
                                    technologies since they provide procedures innovators that expand the reach, quality
                                    and resolution of the different aspects of health care.<br />

                                    How and why do we decide in a certain way? This is a central question asked by
                                    Hammerstein and Stevens (2012) in the book “Evolution and Mechanisms of the
                                    Decision-Making Process”. They claim that our choices are governed by cognitive
                                    mechanisms shaped over time, through the process of natural selection. From the
                                    detection of signals and memory, to individual and social learning, evolution has
                                    created in us strong previous concepts about how and when we process information,
                                    and it is these evolved cognitive building blocks that provide the basis for our
                                    choices. For a specific decision maker, the decisions made for the same problem at
                                    different times can be different, because their preference is not always constant.
                                    Most individuals would like to believe that their decisions are rational and
                                    well-founded; however, research has shown that, as a rule, this does not occur
                                    (MARCH, 1994). It is believed that experience, knowledge and intuition can be guided
                                    through the decision-making process, but the inherent limitation of objectively
                                    processing information often leads the decision maker to failures in the choice
                                    process (RIABACKE, 2012). In addition to the study of human behavior and cognition,
                                    or rather, based on these studies, there is an increasing search for the
                                    implementation of systems through models, algorithms that can assist or even replace
                                    human beings in decision making. Lepri et al. (2018) claim that the combination of
                                    greater availability and large amounts of refined human behavioral data, as well as
                                    advances in machine learning, are generating an increasing dependence on algorithms
                                    to solve complex social problems. Algorithmic decision-making processes can lead to
                                    more objective and, therefore, potentially more just decisions than those made by
                                    human beings that can be influenced by greed, prejudice, fatigue or hunger. However,
                                    algorithmic decision making has been criticized for its potential to increase
                                    discrimination, information asymmetry and power.<br />
                                    In this theme, studies can be submitted that deal with: use of information;
                                    techniques and systems for decision making; modeling; conceptual models in decision;

                                    Society, like the business world, is undergoing a process of digital transformation
                                    (Li, 2018) that was accelerated by the pandemic by COVID-19 (Soto-Acosta, 2020).
                                    This transformation is due to recent technological advances that have allowed the
                                    emergence of new business models, which are now transforming the industrial age
                                    through digital technologies. Many of these transformations are due to the adoption
                                    of 4.0 industry technologies that generate new business models and blockchain.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Industry 4.0 is considered the fourth industrial revolution; it is based on the idea
                                    of creating smart digital factories, facilitating interconnection, and
                                    computerization in a traditional industry, making business more flexible and
                                    responsive to market trends (Lu, 2017). Industry technologies 4.0 (e.g., Internet of
                                    Things, big data, cloud computing, analytics) enable organizations to troubleshoot
                                    in an innovative and/or seize opportunities through new resource rearrangements and
                                    new business models, having been perceived as a source of differentiation in the
                                    market.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The new business models have used digital technologies to gain a competitive
                                    advantage (Fernandes et al., 2017). For this, companies need to improve their
                                    performance by investing in digital technologies and developing digital
                                    capabilities.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The objective of this track is to conceptualize, theorize, and present reasonable
                                    evidence of how digital transformation occurs in organizations through the adoption
                                    and use of new technologies as well as the development of organizational
                                    capacities.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The following questions are suggested:<br />
                                    • What are the capabilities needed for digital transformation?<br />
                                    • How do organizations develop capabilities to leverage digital transformation and
                                    gain competitive advantage?<br />
                                    • How are business models designed, transformed, and managed in the digital
                                    age?<br />
                                    • How to propose value through the use of 4.0 industry technologies?<br />
                                    • How to manage organizational resources in the digital age?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In this context, this theme of Digital Transformation invites authors to submit
                                    their articles on the following topics, but not restricted to them:<br />
                                    • Digital Capabilities and Business Models<br />

                                    Knowledge is an intangible asset relevant to obtaining sustainable competitive
                                    advantage, which makes its management relevant. Knowledge management comprises a set
                                    of processes aimed at creating, storing, sharing, applying and protecting knowledge,
                                    aiming to meet organizational objectives. Information technology, while facilitating
                                    knowledge management, can also increase the risks of losing the competitive
                                    advantage obtained. In this way, organizations need to balance activities that
                                    promote knowledge sharing and protection, in order to maintain their
                                    competitiveness. There are several antecedents that can leverage knowledge
                                    management in the organization, such as social capital, as well as mediating the
                                    relationship of its processes with innovation or organizational performance, such as
                                    absorptive capacity. The proposed theme involves the study of resources and
                                    capacities focused on knowledge at the individual, team, intra-organizational and
                                    inter-organizational levels. Papers with different methodological approaches are
                                    accepted, whether qualitative, quantitative or mixed. In this context, this theme
                                    “Knowledge Management: antecedents, processes and results” invites authors to submit
                                    their articles on the following themes, but not restricted to them:<br />

                                    Project management (PM) has always been present in the area of Information Systems
                                    (IS). However, organizations are increasingly projectized and projects continue to
                                    have high failure rates, whether in term of time, budget, quality goals, and
                                    customer satisfaction, among others. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    In addition, researchers and practitioners are being asked how governance,
                                    collaboration, resource outsourcing, and other strategies are conducted in the
                                    current IT/IS projects. <br />

                                    In this scenario of new realities, artificial intelligence and data science change
                                    the way the team acts and collaborates; projects may involve new approaches to
                                    management, such as Agile methodologies; industry 4.0 technologies such as internet
                                    of things (IoT) and smart systems; as well as global and decentralized IT/IS.<br />

                                    Faced with the dynamics of competitiveness, with challenges that include increasing
                                    competition, increasingly informed customers, rapid technological advances, and
                                    other evolutionary factors that generate expectations, organizations that want to
                                    innovate must develop capabilities to transform environmental changes into
                                    strategies that are always relevant to markets. in transformation. In turbulent
                                    environments, the pressure further increases to be proactive to market demands for
                                    innovative solutions. One of the fundamental concerns of organizations is to
                                    identify, in the environment, variable elements that may enhance their innovative
                                    performance and sources of lasting competitive advantage in order to prepare to face
                                    potential threats and / or seize competitive opportunities. Through the
                                    establishment of structured environmental monitoring processes aimed at capturing
                                    and interpreting informational elements for a better understanding of the ecosystem,
                                    Intelligence enhances the perception of pertinent signals, converting them into
                                    insights that support the anticipation of environmental changes. Intelligence is
                                    strongly associated with strategy as it relates to activities that enable mindful
                                    organizations to reduce uncertainties in the evolving environment by feeding
                                    differentiated information into strategic planning and decision making,
                                    strengthening organizational capacities to compete successfully and grow. with
                                    results. Such an association results in Strategic Intelligence, which concerns the
                                    organization's ability to adapt and anticipate changing business environment
                                    circumstances in a long-term view. Establishing Strategic Intelligence requires
                                    people, processes, and tools that, together, leverage the conversion of
                                    environmental information for adaptation and organizational evolution. With
                                    processes that support the development of sustainable competitive advantages through
                                    the systematic detection of environmental signals, Intelligence has been considered
                                    a distinctive factor in organizational sustainability, requiring efforts in the
                                    pursuit of establishing differential processes, supported by tools and technologies
                                    that facilitate, by an implied collective, the conversion of signals into
                                    differential insights. In response to this problem, the Strategic Management and

                                    The world is undergoing the largest wave of urban growth in history and the number
                                    of people living in towns and cities is expected to increase to 5 billion by 2030.
                                    It is not easy to manage this growth; therefore, good governance is needed to find a
                                    smart way to deal with the density of urban life. At the same time, it is observed
                                    that a new era of transformation is emerging in which residents and their
                                    surrounding environments are increasingly connected through intelligent technologies
                                    or digital technologies. All these changes offer a greater likelihood for improved
                                    wellbeing and prosperity, while challenges at the complex intersection of technology
                                    and society are turning up. This track aims at exploring how society is managing and
                                    coping with urban challenges in the search of innovative solutions leading to a
                                    better quality of life and sustainability in cities. It also includes investigations
                                    related to smart governance, technologies for resilient cities, citizen co-creation,
                                    and co-production. Furthermore, it addresses the development in smart cities policy

                                    Public Administration, considered as an operative agent of the State, is required to
                                    reorganize itself, and to elaborate management models that meet social, political
                                    and economic requirements and needs. The reformulation and modernization of the
                                    public administration, in order to rationalize actions and increase the
                                    effectiveness of its institutions, responding with agility and competence to the
                                    demands of the Government and society, are increasingly necessary.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The new theoretical perspectives point towards both a greater importance and a
                                    greater complexity of the role of the State, arguing that efficient public
                                    institutions and new political connections with society become fundamental in the
                                    provision of services associated with the expansion of human capacities (POLLITT ;
                                    BOUCKAERT, 2000).<br />

                                    For Pacheco (2010), Brazil faces a double challenge in its public administration:
                                    first, the construction of a bureaucracy along the Weberian lines, which has
                                    remained unfinished since the first attempt to modernize the state under the Vargas
                                    regime; second, to provide it with professionalism regarding competence, commitment
                                    to results and performance. In other words, the challenge of associating the
                                    rational-legal principles of the bureaucratic model with effective management and
                                    guided by organizational performance and the creation of public value.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Considering these aspects, the relevance and pertinence of the proposition of the
                                    theme State, Organizations and Public Management: reforms and innovations within the

                                    <br />
                                    According to Kliksberg (1992, p.45), public administration and its functioning,
                                    modernization of the State and administrative reforms are not unhistorical: “they
                                    are part of a global historical process that marked it deeply in its central and
                                    which she in turn contributed to modeling. (...) His visceral historicity determines
                                    that many of the problems he presents are not endogenous; they are the
                                    manifestations, at their level, of structural problems of society as a whole ”<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In view of the above, this theme will welcome theoretical, empirical and / or

                                    This theme means to discuss the characteristics, potentialities, challenges and
                                    dilemmas that emerge in the relationship between the State and distinct civil
                                    society organizations, formalized or not. In a time of proliferation of governance
                                    arrangements across various sectors and levels of government, relations between the
                                    State and civil society - whether collaborative or confrontative, spontaneous or
                                    forced - are structural components of democracy and have a direct effect on how
                                    society deals with what is public and with public problems.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The proposals of the New Public Management movement, which recommends hiring
                                    non-profit organizations to deliver public services, still resonate in academic
                                    bodies and in public management, to promote efficiency. However, the possibilities
                                    of relationship between the State, citizens and civil society organizations go
                                    beyond this type of interaction, contemplating a diversity of forms and content to
                                    define and deal with public problems, which can be understood as part of a New
                                    Public Governance. Besides efficiency, elements such as collaboration, pluralism,
                                    transparency, trust, citizen participation and accountability are valued as a means
                                    to produce public goods and services and to deal with complex democracy challenges.
                                    Some of these values ??and practices, however, can be considered relevant or useful
                                    even in non-democratic contexts. The relations between the State and civil society,
                                    when meaning to collaborate, also include conflict, negotiation and mediation of
                                    diverse interests, even forms of co-option and coercion. In this sense, the
                                    practices covered in this theme may consist of, but are not restricted to:<br />
                                    a) Democratic governance, collaboration, partnerships and the coproduction of public
                                    goods and services;<br />
                                    b) Advocacy and the civil society’s role in the formulation, implementation,
                                    evaluation and monitoring of public actions;<br />
                                    c) Relations between governments and civil society, participatory institutions and
                                    mechanisms, and the contribution to the increase of transparency, control and
                                    accountability;<br />
                                    d) Conflict, cooptation and mobilization and articulation mechanisms to control the
                                    exercise of power;<br />
                                    e) Actions aimed at territorial development, including social technologies, notably
                                    those bringing qualitative and quantitative investigations that point to non-state
                                    organizations’ actions as public interest drivers.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Considering the contemporary context, this theme embraces with particular attention,
                                    but not only, papers focused on the following matters:<br />
                                    - The relationship created between civil society and governments to deal with the
                                    COVID-19 pandemic, the environmental crisis, the inequality increase and with
                                    social, cultural and political elements arising from this context;<br />
                                    - Understanding of the management and articulation strategies adopted by civil
                                    society to enhance its performance in relation to the solution of public
                                    problems;<br />
                                    - The advance of authoritarianism and the setback in the participation agenda, with
                                    the potential to close the dialogue and partnerships between governments and civil
                                    society organizations, reducing participatory institutions.<br />

                                    The theme aims to debate how the federal pact and intergovernmental relations in
                                    Brazil have been affected by the critical Brazilian situation marked by the dispute
                                    and confrontation between different spheres of government. This issue is
                                    particularly acute in social welfare policies, in which decentralization and
                                    accountability for implementation at the subnational level is accompanied by federal
                                    coordination and funding. This model of federative cooperation materialized, above
                                    all, through public policy systems has been a central mark, at least, of the last
                                    two decades. Since the overlapping of competences, originally conceived by the
                                    constitutional framework in numerous matters over the years, several federal
                                    recentralization measures have been added and reduced the autonomy of the
                                    subnational spheres. To this also could be added the intensification of a
                                    conflicting federative dynamic that affects intergovernmental cooperation. The
                                    COVID-19 pandemic triggered and opened especially a logic of federative disputes in
                                    which subnational governments have started competed with the Federal Government in
                                    terms of protagonism. A deleterious effect has been the loss of interconnection
                                    between political actors and the institutional functioning of public policies, which
                                    places the epidemiological crisis at the center of the dimension of territorial
                                    politics that affects federations and countries with federalized mechanisms. In the
                                    case of Brazil, this process is strongly influenced by federal political inaction in
                                    the fight against Pandemic, which has induced a type of political game that needs to
                                    be analyzed in perspective, as its effects on public policies and intergovernmental
                                    cooperation must be prolonged. Intergovernmental relations were already in a process
                                    of change before this crisis, but their effects intensified during the pandemic,
                                    when the need for a coordinating role for the Union became more evident. This is

                                    The theme proposes to discuss researches and applied studies and applications of
                                    public policies in a multi and interdisciplinary perspective and also in the
                                    tradition of policy orientation. 'Policy oriented' studies, as defined in the policy
                                    sciences literature, are those that accumulate aspects of multidisciplinarity (and
                                    interdisciplinarity), normativity and animosity in problem solving for public
                                    wellbeing. The theme seeks to emphasize the analysis of cases of governmental and
                                    public policies, programs, projects and activities, as well as non-state and / or
                                    societal public actions that relate to governmental public policies in the most
                                    diverse dimensions and sectors of intervention: economic, social, environmental,
                                    cultural, infrastructure, educational, science, technology and innovation,
                                    administrative intervention, territorial development policies, programs and
                                    projects, among others possibilities. The theme focuses on techniques and tools of
                                    public policies with applied approach, particularly on the process of intervention
                                    and social and organizational changes. Other theoretical matrices that feed into the
                                    debate on the achievement and applicability of public policy will also be considered
                                    for contradictory analysis. Methodologically, the theme prioritizes case studies,
                                    multi-cases and comparative analyzes without, however, discarding other research
                                    methods. The assembly of the sections will be carried out primarily by sectoral
                                    public policies, however considering the sectoral interrelationship, when
                                    applicable.

                                    institutional arrangements that facilitate the delivery of quality public services
                                    are indispensable. Also, all professionals work and research the topics listed in
                                    the proposal: public administration, public services, public service delivery,
                                    management of public organizations, coproduction of public services, and public
                                    policies, among others. Another factor considered in team building is their
                                    participation in several graduation programs from several Brazilian institutions, as
                                    we can see by their curriculum. Also, all researchers have the publication of a high
                                    impact in their fields.

                                    organizations, digital transformation in the public sector, design thinking,
                                    stakeholder analysis, public entrepreneurship, among others. It is a relevant topic
                                    as it proposes to bring together research that explores the paths for quality public
                                    management on its most different fronts, that is, in its functional areas.
                                    Especially in the current global crisis, which poses different restrictions and
                                    limitations to public organizations, combined with a conjecture of transformations
                                    in the environmental context - for example, those related to social and
                                    technological changes, among others - it becomes even more fundamental to direct
                                    research efforts that aim at gathering engaged scholars investigating organizational
                                    efficiency and quality in the provision of public services.

                                    In the Brazilian public administration scenario, the discussion regarding
                                    ontological and epistemological matrices has been raised aiming to report the
                                    importance of comprehending the field through a plural perspective. More precisely,
                                    there is the need to think of new, little explored metatheoretical paths, inspired
                                    by frameworks diverse in the analysis of the new demands of contemporary public
                                    administration. There is also a lack of studies that use critical, hermeneutic and
                                    phenomenological approaches – here specifically the critical theory as a guide to
                                    studies in public administration. Therefore, this theme proposes to strengthen an
                                    agenda of researches that discuss the theoretical strengthening of the public
                                    administration field beyond the empirical perspective. It is sought, above all, to
                                    strengthen a disciplinary, interdisciplinary and/or multidisciplinary investigation
                                    in public administration. Work proposals aimed at articulating public administration
                                    both in technical and political, social and cultural perspectives, are welcomed.
                                    Thus, the theme turns to the debate on the multi/interdisciplinary theoretical
                                    foundations of public administration. Construction process, design and development
                                    of the field of public administration from the ontological, epistemological and
                                    methodological perspectives. Paradigms and models of public management. Discussions
                                    on the theoretical approaches that focus on reflection and analysis of the objects
                                    of field study: currents of institutionalism, new public management, new public
                                    service, public governance, and others. Studies on the methodological perspectives
                                    in public administration research.

                                    n the last fifteen years, in the wake of the celebration of several important
                                    events, such as the 200 years of the transfer of the Portuguese Court to Rio de
                                    Janeiro and the 130 years of the Republic, alongside more permanent initiatives,
                                    punctual (but significant) efforts have emerged that attest to the renewed interest
                                    in historical studies in the field of public administration. Thus, several recent
                                    publications have joined the vigorous historiographical production that flourished
                                    in the area until the 1980s.<br />
                                    It is true that we are far from the vigor of academic production of essays and
                                    textbooks from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. But in 2019, the Republic completed 130
                                    years and in the next 2022, Brazil will celebrate 200 years of Independence.
                                    Certainly, interest in the topic will grow and raise the value of intellectual
                                    production in the field.<br />
                                    On the other hand, little progress has been made towards incorporating the main
                                    achievements of contemporary historiography into this historiographical production.
                                    In fact, most of the recent work that contributed to the renewal of the field did
                                    little to overcome the limitations indicated by the critic that addressed the
                                    monumental Administrative History of Brazil, started by DASP in the 1950s.<br />
                                    The rediscovery of the importance of historical knowledge and the mutual influence
                                    between countries in the field of Public Administration must be accompanied by the
                                    renewal of themes, sources and research methods, with the production of
                                    dissertations, articles and books that discuss the transformations of the State and
                                    Administration Brazilian public in a historical and comparative perspective. There
                                    is much to discuss about this process, especially at the present moment in Brazilian
                                    life when all institutions are at stake. As Unamuno has already said, we need to
                                    know history to avoid repeating it. Neither as a tragedy nor as a farce.<br />
                                    The theme welcomes works that rescue the memory of the Brazilian Public
                                    Administration, historiographical studies on Brazilian education and comparative
                                    studies, particularly with other countries in Latin America. Important objects for
                                    discussion and analysis are: State History, institutional history and administrative
                                    history, Public Administration Memory, Evolution of Public Management, Comparative
                                    Studies. Historiography of the Brazilian Public Administration. Sources for the
                                    history of Public Administration. Memory of the Brazilian Public Administration.
                                    Life stories. Statesmen. Public Administration in Latin America. Administration for
                                    development. Public Administration in an international perspective.<br />
                                    In this sense, it addresses Public Administration as a total social fact,
                                    establishing connections between economic, social, political, cultural and
                                    institutional transformations, rescuing the memory of the trajectory of public
                                    management and valuing comparative studies.

                                    Recent studies on social management indicate that its definition seeks to
                                    incorporate aspects related to citizenship spaces, interorganizational relations and
                                    public administration. The proposal is to incorporate social management into
                                    community practice, showing its potential to develop in different contexts.<br />
                                    Therefore, it is considered that the interfaces between Public Management and Social
                                    Management discuss the intersections and theoretical and methodological
                                    distinctions, as well as the practices between social management, public
                                    administration and development. Participatory democracy expects a closer
                                    relationship between the state and society whose protagonist ceases to be the state
                                    that mediates discussions and deliberations with the various actors of civil
                                    society. In this regard, and especially considering the challenges of the current
                                    political and social context of the country, it is relevant to propose articles
                                    involving research on: Social management, governance and public policies. Social
                                    management, transparency and accountability. Social management and co-production of
                                    public goods. Social management in sustainable development programs and projects -
                                    social, environmental and territorial dimensions. Social Management in cultural
                                    policies. Social policy management: inequality, justice and democracy. Social
                                    innovation, collective action and cooperation for the common good. Active
                                    citizenship, participation and public action. Social management and social control
                                    in public collective environments: forums, collegiate boards and councils.<br />
                                    The purpose of this theme is to explore academic research that seeks to contribute
                                    to the theoretical advance in the interfaces between Social Management and Public
                                    Management - with theoretical and conceptual models, as well as with empirical
                                    applications that seek to analyze pragmatic examples. Such proposal is believed to
                                    be relevant to researchers and research groups in the area.<br />

                                    Governance for Sustainability in Public Management discusses studies related to the
                                    United Nations development agenda in 2030, which requires "a supremely ambitious and
                                    transformative vision" and proposes seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
                                    to guarantee good health and wellbeing for countries, our planet and future
                                    generations. The SDGs outline an ambitious agenda that individuals, public and
                                    private organizations and society have great potential and the capacity to
                                    contribute. Sustainable development and the 2030 agenda, in particular, brought
                                    together a wide range of stakeholders from science, civil society, government and
                                    business. Many expressed their commitments to improve the well-being of the planet
                                    and society and join efforts to implement the agenda. A growing body of research has
                                    developed in recent decades on the governance of sustainable development. However,
                                    important gaps still exist. Thus, the theme invites articles that involve research
                                    on the various experiences of implementing the agenda in the different objectives
                                    and levels of governance and unresolved issues related to the role, capacity and
                                    impacts of companies, governments, society and international organizations to
                                    address sustainable development issues. Each of the above perspectives has an
                                    institutional dynamic that directs corporations in certain (non) sustainable
                                    directions, and these dynamics vary across scales, places and sectors. Attention to
                                    the meta roles of organizations in governance, that is, steering, making or breaking
                                    good governance and the level at which it occurs, that is, micro, meso and macro.

                                    Race Relations in Brazil is a little discussed topic in the field of Administration,
                                    Public Administration and Public Policy. Our society has denied the existence of
                                    racism as a structuring element for our underdevelopment process and a driving cause
                                    of the various forms of social inequality. The hegemonic myth of racial democracy
                                    from the end of slavery until the mid-1980s presupposed the harmonious coexistence
                                    of blacks and whites, unlike the situations of the US or South Africa. From the
                                    historical denunciations of civil society Organized led by the various currents of
                                    the black movement and the analysis of vertical relations in all sectors of society,
                                    this Brazilian utopia was stripped to reveal intense racial inequalities expressed
                                    in countless social indicators. Only in the last two decades has the government
                                    recognized this social abyss and implemented measures to address it. Until the last
                                    century, governmental measures were restricted to initiatives to combat (repressive)
                                    racism and to value the African (culturalist) matrix. This new response from the
                                    Brazilian government was due to the increasingly qualified pressure from black
                                    movements, academics and progressive sectors, as well as institutional tension in
                                    universities, subnational governments and societal organizations. The literature
                                    shows that from the results of the Third World Conference against Racism (Durban,
                                    2001), Brazil became one of the countries that most implemented public policies to
                                    combat racism and promote racial equality in accordance with the UN Plan of Action.
                                    Conference: creation of the Ministry for the Promotion of Racial Equality and
                                    several similar state and municipal agencies. However, the economic and
                                    political-institutional crisis that has been plaguing the country since 2013, has
                                    had harmful consequences for the sustainability of all the arrangements created. In
                                    addition to several ideological resistances to the new public management model,
                                    recent years have shown a political slowdown, loss of institutional space and
                                    problems in implementing strategic actions, such as frauds in affirmative action
                                    policies for access to universities and public jobs and poor adherence to
                                    anti-racist policy in schools. Given this scenario, we seek to discuss the advances
                                    and challenges in the field of Public Administration and Public Policy regarding the
                                    integral treatment of Race Relations as an endogenous element to the object of
                                    research and teaching of these areas of knowledge. The topics proposed for
                                    articulation of race relations, public administration and/or public policies:
                                    structural and institutional racism; political administration and ethnic racial
                                    relations in contemporary Brazil; affirmative action; transversality and
                                    intersectionality; public security policies; race relations, bureaucracy and
                                    institutional arrangements; administrative records and data analysis on black
                                    population; representative bureaucracy; racial issues, public problems and
                                    democracy; black entrepreneurs; migration, a new black diaspora and racism.

                                    Discusses the relationship between public administration, participation and the
                                    democratic rule of law. Democratic experiments as practices to increase
                                    effectiveness, legitimacy, social justice and innovation in public administration.
                                    Scope and limits of democratic participatory action in political systems, governance
                                    and public action in governmental and non-governmental organizations, institutions
                                    and territories. Dynamics of collective learning, public investigation, social
                                    control and accountability, social innovations and innovations in the public sector
                                    and co-construction of responses to public problems, based on social participation
                                    and collaborative governance processes.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Justification:<br />

                                    This theme seeks to open space for debates, theoretical and empirical, on the
                                    phenomenon of “democratic experimentation”, based on participatory action in public
                                    administration. It focuses on bottom-up processes based on democratic participation
                                    and in the interface between different actors, resources, practices and knowledge in
                                    public management.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In Brazil, as well as in other countries, after the re-democratization, the
                                    Constitution and the regulatory frameworks of the public administration started to
                                    encourage a collaborative public management co-built by public managers and other
                                    civil society agents, strengthening systems of deliberative democracy (Midlej and
                                    Silva, 2019). However, more recently, we have witnessed the resumption of more
                                    authoritarian government regimes around the world, with anti-democratic speeches and
                                    refractory to participation. In this new scenario and, in view of the challenges
                                    posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic, there is a need and urgency to (re) discuss the
                                    processes of democratic experimentation and their relationship with the public
                                    administration.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    This debate is current and very important, especially in view of the effects of the
                                    COVID-19 pandemic, and the crises of modern democracies around the world, cosidering
                                    their consequences in public administration and public governance. This opens up a
                                    broad research agenda on the scope and limits of collaborative governance and other
                                    forms of democratic action in renewing public administration, both at the
                                    international level (Fung and Wright, 2003, Bohman, 2012; Ansell, 2007, 2012; Ansell
                                    and Torfing, 2018, Ansell, Sorensen and Torfing, 2020) and in Brazil (Milani, 2008;
                                    Vaz, 2011; Avritzer, 2017; Andion et al, 2017; Midlej e Silva, 2019, Andion,
                                    2020).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In view of this, the scientific and practical relevance of this panel is placed,
                                    which aims to broaden the understanding of the scope and limits of new democratic
                                    experiments to advance and create new debate agendas and new practices in public
                                    administration. In particular, we are interested in exploring new theoretical and
                                    analytical perspectives for the study of democratic experiments and participatory
                                    action in different fields of practice such as political systems, public governance,
                                    public policy management, public action in territories, institutions and
                                    governmental and non-governmental organizations.

                                    between the management science field (MSF) and the studies of the international. We
                                    start from the premise that at the international and global levels one may find
                                    phenomena and social processes which particularities have been meddling the objects
                                    of MSF such as business, the State, public policies, management and sustainability
                                    of civil society’s organizations, and even the capitalist modes of development and
                                    production, among others. Thus, in several Management, Accountant and Tourism
                                    graduate programs are a growing interest in cross borders, supranational, and even
                                    global subjects and social process.<br />

                                    Besides the business internationalization topic, the main ideia here it to gather

                                    This theme encourages research that seek to study bureaucracy (as structure and
                                    actors) and its contemporary transformations from multiple analytical lenses. The
                                    theme welcomes studies that focus on contemporary bureaucratic trends and functions,
                                    such as autonomy, the role of auditing, supervisory and controlling bodies (such as
                                    the courts of account, controllers, public prosecutors, among others),
                                    agencification, regulation and the role of regulatory agencies, consolidation of the
                                    center of government or bureaucratic representativeness. Papers that seek to
                                    diagnose how bureaucratic agents respond to sometimes conflicting social and
                                    political pressures are particularly welcome, such as the interaction of
                                    bureaucratic dynamics with the fight against corruption, with populism, or with the
                                    tendency to strengthen external and internal controls. How do these pressures affect
                                    bureaucratic reputation and your ability to implement public policies? Studies are
                                    invited that analyze conceptually and empirically the collective actors that
                                    implement public policies, from the high echelon, the middle echelon to the street
                                    bureaucracy, observing their performance, behavior and interactions with other
                                    actors. The theme also encourages research carried out in the Latin American context
                                    or other contexts that may serve as a basis for consolidating research compared with
                                    Brazil. And we encourage research about state capabilities and policy instruments.

                                    Recently in Brazil, the Federal Government send to National Congress a proposal
                                    (Constitutional Amendment 32/2020) that seek to change the rules about civil
                                    servants and administrative organization. This proposal brought, again, for
                                    Brazilian public debate the Theme State Reform and Administrative Reform. In this
                                    way, is important to remember that in 1936, Getulio Vargas was the President that
                                    begun this process and that at this moment the discussion gains density, intensity
                                    and different point of views according to the content of the proposals.<br />
                                    A long process of PEC 32/2020 is expected in the National Congress, which will not
                                    end with the enactment of the Amendment if approved. Many measures depend on
                                    complementary laws and ordinary laws that will be approved by the National Congress
                                    and by the sub-national level. Until then, the debate will gain the attention of the
                                    academy, the sectors of civil society, and the Media. In a preliminary assessment,
                                    the criticisms are directed at the lack of clear objectives to reduce public
                                    spending; the lack of a consistent diagnosis, which provides precise figures about
                                    personnel expenses; the total absence of a solid conceptual base that guides the
                                    formulation of principles and guidelines; due to the fragility of the arguments
                                    related to changes in the legal regime of public servants. In this case, many
                                    situations of legal uncertainty may be created.<br />
                                    These criticisms show important discussions about the democratic state, the scope,
                                    and limits of state intervention, the principles of good public administration, and
                                    point us to some of the constant problems of public management. Issues such as the
                                    fiscal crisis and the supposed exhaustion of the Welfare model are highlighted in
                                    this debate. These questions lead us to think about the provision of basic social
                                    services, the income of individuals, and the quality of life of the Brazilian
                                    population. They also are relating to the formulation of public policies, the state
                                    capacities to implement them, institutional arrangements for intergovernmental
                                    relations and partnerships with society and the market, and, finally, the public
                                    investment and social services.<br />

                                    in the international context and historical perspective. It is important to focus on

                                    This theme aims to stimulate studies on innovation in the public sector, an area of
                                    research of public administration still embryonic, but promising. The purpose is to
                                    advance innovation in management, policy, and public services in different
                                    government levels and subjects with a focus on the formulation and implementation
                                    processes, generation of public value, results, and impacts, as well as challenges
                                    and learning. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    We encourage studies that analyze and/or question: the innovation cycle – problem
                                    identification, generation of ideas, prototyping, implementation, and dissemination;
                                    the tools and techniques used in the innovation process, among which stand out
                                    design thinking, agile methods, and design sprint, innovation management in public
                                    organizations, and the role of policy entrepreneurs. Analyses of different
                                    innovation strategies that include co-creation and social participation,
                                    experimentalism in management, digital democracy, behavioral economics applied to
                                    public policies, open innovation (public challenges, hackathons, crowdsourcing,
                                    etc.), gamification, as well as the roles of innovation laboratories. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    This theme also values empirical approaches on the role of innovation in: i)
                                    processes of improvement of the results delivered to society by public
                                    organizations, in terms of efficiency, quality, learning, transparency, among others
                                    and; ii) in understanding and efforts to solve complex and uncertain problems
                                    (wicked problems), such as inequality, climate change, sustainable development,
                                    aging of the population and, more recently, the pandemic of Covid-19 with its
                                    multidimensional implications.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    We encourage a broad understanding of the idea of innovation, and therefore it is
                                    not necessary to focus only on technological innovation, but also on services,
                                    processes, change management, or organizational development. When there is a focus
                                    on technology, especially on frontier issues such as the internet of things (IoT),
                                    blockchain, use and development of algorithms, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), it
                                    is suggested a broad and critical appreciation, which discusses problems,
                                    difficulties and consequences of the adoption of such tools, in addition to
                                    potentials or advantages. Finally, discussions on hiring, evaluating, or supervising
                                    innovation by the government are also welcome. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    We reinforce the importance that submitted articles dialogue with some of the
                                    theoretical perspectives of innovation in the public sector – the cycle of
                                    innovation, diffusion, barriers and incentives, co-creation, experimentalism,
                                    stakeholder theory, degree of innovation, etc. – in order to contribute to the
                                    construction of a shared analytical framework for scientific research of government
                                    experiences. The lens of innovation can even be associated with other theories – the
                                    cycle of public policies, governance, democracy, and social participation,
                                    intergovernmental relations, state capacity, entrepreneurship, etc. – in order to
                                    develop a more sophisticated and complementary analysis matrix. <br />

                                    The challenges of regional development are relevant to the academy due to their
                                    effects on local social well-being, and also because regional development is the
                                    driving force behind the promotion of social, economic and local development.
                                    However, regional development effectively occurs when there is an exchange of social
                                    capital between agents and local organizations. The existence of social capital
                                    (trust, commitment, local identity, shared culture, collaboration, etc.) stimulates
                                    and strengthens the relationship between them. Such social capital creates local
                                    specialities and differential knowledge, based on the specific way of working
                                    locally, which overlaps the individual performance of each organization. Therefore,
                                    it is up to the public authorities, especially policymakers, to stimulate local
                                    agents not only with institutional support but also promoting relationships and
                                    exchanges between them. From these exchanges, local potentials with a social base
                                    are created, capable of increasing the legitimation of local knowledge through the
                                    creation of regional brands, geographical indications and clusters with a more
                                    remarkable power of joint competitiveness. Besides, exchanges between agents and
                                    local organizations allow the creation of an ecosystem that stimulates the
                                    development of specialized local industries, and, consequently, stimulates local
                                    entrepreneurship through spill-over and spin-off movements.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Therefore, starting from the locality's associated thinking, regional development
                                    and social capital, it is expected to generate intriguing and essential discussions
                                    about how the locality can develop and catalyze its growth. In addition to seeking
                                    to deepen discussions of a social nature for regional development, we hope to
                                    understand how intermediary agents, such as policymakers, can bring influential
                                    contributions to exchanges between local agents and stimulate regional
                                    development.<br />

                                    The School of Administration of the Federal University of Bahia (EAUFBA) is a
                                    pioneer in the discussion of political administration in the country. This history
                                    comes from the contributions of João Ubaldo Ribeiro, when he held the chair of the
                                    Political Science discipline at EAUFBA, in the seminal work Political and
                                    Administration (1969), (re) published in 2006 by the journal Organizações &
                                    Sociedade. The discussion gains consistency with the thesis defended by Reginaldo
                                    Souza Santos at the Institute of Economics of UNICAMP (1991) and with the article
                                    Administração Pública Brasileira (1993), published in Revista de Administração
                                    Pública. However, it is in the early 2000s that the definition of political
                                    administration, as a field of knowledge, stands out in Brazilian literature.
                                    Political Administration, as a subfield of Administration, has the scientific and
                                    professional purpose, to contribute so that political and professional
                                    administrators can be trained to observe, describe, explain, evidence, criticize,
                                    standardize and propose administrative and organizational solutions (in the field
                                    management and management) that effectively contribute to articulating the two
                                    inseparable dimensions that involve 'administrative and organizational acts and
                                    facts' and / or 'administrative and organizational practices and knowledge', through
                                    the integration between 'Thinking' and Acir '; between the political dimension of
                                    management and the technical-operational dimension of management. The proposed theme
                                    aims to open space for the presentation and discussion of studies aimed at the
                                    analysis of the management models of the development of diverse theoretical currents
                                    such as structuralism, post-structuralism, multiculturalism and post-colonialism
                                    (Cepaline Development, Neoliberalism, New -Developmentalism, Post-Developmentalism,
                                    etc.), in order to highlight the implications of models in the daily lives of
                                    individuals, organizations and society; as well as studies aimed at analyzing and /
                                    or evaluating the effects of the Brazilian Political Administration on the
                                    distribution of wealth and social income.

                                    Since the advent of New Public Management (NPM), research and discussion of how
                                    changes in institutions, processes, systems, policies and organizations have yielded
                                    useful insights into ways to improve governance (Rodhes, 1996; Lynn et al, 2000;
                                    Almqvist et al, 2013; Fukuyama, 2013; Capano, 2014; Frederickson et al 2015;
                                    Grindle, 2017; Tonelli et al, 2017). From a local perspective, a challenge is
                                    presented about who governs governance and how responsibilities can be attributed
                                    between the actors involved and significant accountability issues (Casula, 2017),
                                    revealing the importance of accountability in this process as well. In the view of
                                    Lynn Jr, Heinrich and Hill (2000), among the questions that motivate the systematic
                                    study of public governance in the public field are: (i) How can more administrative
                                    entities be best executed? ”(Ii) How Can public sector schemes, agencies, programs
                                    and activities be organized and managed to achieve public objectives? (iii) How can
                                    the Government continually improve performance in order to earn the respect of
                                    paying citizens whose lives are affected by its regulatory programs and activities?
                                    Challenges like these are daily faced by Brazilian public managers, especially when
                                    it comes to managers of subnational entities (Silva Corralo, 2015). With the
                                    promulgation of the Federal Constitution of 1988, Brazilian Municipalities had their
                                    autonomy and protagonism recognized, but despite this institutional advance, the
                                    decentralization of power to the municipal sphere did not previously consider the
                                    inequalities of the Brazilian territory and created different “Brazils”. This
                                    diversity eventually limited and compromised the conditions for the exercise of
                                    municipal competences shared with other spheres and deepened the local and regional
                                    disparities of the country. In practice, it is observed that in most of the
                                    Brazilian territory the increase of the responsibility attributed to the
                                    Municipalities by the 1988 Constitution was not accompanied by an adequate
                                    administrative-financial structure to manage and monitor the new actions to be
                                    implemented, and thus Achieving the expected goals has thus become a challenge for
                                    municipal managers. In addition to the scarcity of funding sources and the
                                    increasing demand for resources to meet social policies such as health, education
                                    and social assistance, which weakens the municipal economy, the inability of
                                    administrative systems to act effectively and decisively to solve public problems.
                                    makes the municipalities unable to reach the necessary conditions to develop. It is
                                    in this environment that arises the discussion of public policies of governance and
                                    accountability, materialized in the form of mechanisms of leadership, resilience,
                                    strategy and control to evaluate, direct and monitor municipal public management,
                                    with a view to conducting public policies and providing services of interest to
                                    society. The thematic section invites contributions that explore different aspects
                                    of governance and accountability from the perspective of local governments. All
                                    theoretical and methodological approaches are welcome.<br />

                                    This research stream focuses on the interdisciplinary nature of management
                                    accounting and it focuses on the relationship between management accounting and
                                    human behavior, organizational and institutional structures and processes, and the
                                    broader socio-political environment of the company. This stream of research aims to
                                    challenge and extend our understanding of management accounting roles and related
                                    emerging and technical practices in the construction of economic and social actors,
                                    and their modes of economic organization, including ways in which such practices
                                    influence and are influenced by market development and others institutions. This
                                    research stream seeks to expand the view that organizational actors are always
                                    rational who make efficient decisions. The rational explanation is the dominant
                                    perspective in the management accounting literature, and it has the assumption that
                                    the adoption / use of a practice will always bring economic benefits for the
                                    organization. However, an alternative stream of research has shown that this
                                    rational perspective has failed to explain how cultural and social aspects influence
                                    the adoption and use of a management practice. Thus, this alternative stream of
                                    research has highlighted the importance of studying phenomena in the area of
                                    management accounting in a more comprehensive way involving aspects related to
                                    social, cultural and political pressures in the process of adoption and use of
                                    management accounting practices. Thus, in this theme, studies are sought that are
                                    based on diverse methodologies and theoretical developments from all social
                                    sciences, and that illuminate the development, processes and effects of management
                                    accounting in its organizational, political, historical and social contexts. This
                                    stream of research covers, but is not limited to, the following topics: the roles of
                                    management accounting in organizations and society; the contribution of management
                                    accounting practices to the emergence, maintenance and transformation of
                                    organizational and social institutions; the roles of management accounting in the
                                    development of new organizational and institutional forms, both public and private;
                                    the relationships between management accounting, accountability, ethics and social
                                    justice; behavioral studies of management accounting practices and of the providers,
                                    verifiers and users of accounting information, including cognitive aspects of the
                                    measurement, judgment and decision-making processes; the behavioral aspects of the
                                    planning, control and evaluation processes; studies of organizational processes for
                                    the design, implementation and use of management control systems; social,
                                    organizational, political and psychological studies of the process of setting

                                    There are several points of intersection between Innovation Management and
                                    Management Accounting, especially with regard to the contribution of both in the
                                    survival and adaptability of the business with a view to development.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Information from management accounting can be used as a catalyst for innovation,
                                    providing different types of innovation (products, services, processes, marketing
                                    and organizational) and in different perspectives (incremental, radical or
                                    disruptive), however, the unbalanced use of some artifacts can inhibit creativity,
                                    organizational learning and, consequently, innovation.<br />

                                    e) the impact of the use of management accounting artifacts and innovation

                                    Accounting has one of its main objectives to provide useful information about the
                                    entities to its various users since a part is directed to the external public. As
                                    business activities' size and complexity grow, the information needs of managers and
                                    other users of Accounting become increasingly different. The latter needs an
                                    increasing demand for accounting information so that they can judge the manager and
                                    the company's performance and monitor the preparation and execution of the
                                    contracts.<br />
                                    The concept of accounting information quality becomes complex and depends on the
                                    purpose of its user. Therefore, it has become one of the main discussion topics in
                                    the academic and professional environment. The concept of what would be 'quality of
                                    accounting information' is related to its users' consensus, observing the market
                                    institutional and organizational characteristics, taking into account the economic,
                                    social, cultural, and even temporal aspects. In addition, the quality of accounting
                                    information is linked to behavioral, economic, institutional and cultural theories,
                                    among other internal and external factors. The topic of Accounting Information

                                    a. persistence,<br />

                                    currently also studied from an economic-financial perspective (Zambom-Ferraresi,

                                    managers, creditors, investors, government, and fans. <br />
                                    The related literature points out a critical distinctiveness when evaluating the
                                    performance of these organizations. It is necessary to examine from two
                                    perspectives: results in the game field and economic success (Guzmán, 2006).
                                    Therefore, the objectives are oriented towards achieving profit maximization and
                                    sporting success (Sloane, 2015; Terrien, Scelles, Morrow, Maltese, & Durand, 2017).
                                    <br />
                                    Szymanski (2017) argues that sports performance is measured weekly, and financial
                                    resources management is carried out at their level. The achievement of victories
                                    and, consequently, titles tend to impact financial results positively.<br />
                                    On the other hand, consecutive defeats can ultimately lead to club bankruptcy
                                    (Alaminos & Fernandez, 2019; Scelles, Morrow, Maltese, & Durand, 2017). Under
                                    another aspect of club management, there is still a typical scenario: poor
                                    management, financial crises, and corruption scandals. These are determined to a
                                    certain extent based on the low level of transparency of information about the
                                    teams' management and their consequent evaluation. In this sense, Governance and its
                                    acceptable practices can help minimize this scenario and contribute to
                                    professionalizing management and the teams' financial and administrative
                                    reorganization (Marques & Costa, 2016; Ruta, Lorenzon, & Sironi, 2019).<br />

                                    to the planning, execution, evaluation and control processes of public and private

                                    the company. Approaches such as activity-based costing, the balanced scorecard,
                                    target costing and kaizen costing are some of the many examples of techniques that
                                    proliferate in international Management Accounting manuals (Major, 2011). To
                                    Atkinson et al. (2011), management accounting information can assist decision makers
                                    since they are able to measure the economic performance of operating units. Another
                                    factor is that such information can be used as a tool in which workers can get
                                    feedback on their performance in the organization, a fact that generates learning

                                    Corporate Governance, for Siffert (1998) came to have relevance with the emergence
                                    of modern corporations, such organizations have the segregation between ownership
                                    and control as the main characteristic. Among the internal mechanisms stands out,
                                    for example, the action of the Board of Directors, since as an external mechanism,
                                    the mandatory publication of information about the company is highlighted (SILVEIRA,
                                    2002). Studies related to governance and auditing in organizations, such as risk

                                    as: audit (internal and/or external), compliance, supervisory board, board of

                                    The concept of sustainable development results from a relatively long historical
                                    process of critical reassessment of the relationship between civil society and its
                                    natural environment. Because it is a continuous and complex process, today there are
                                    several approaches that seek to explain the concept of sustainability. This variety
                                    can be verified by the numerous definitions related to this concept (Van Bellen,
                                    2004). Studies addressing the applications of accounting for sustainability and

                                    Critical and Interpretive Accounting Studies stream aims to cast a critical eye over
                                    accounting in its broadest social and political context, embracing historical
                                    perspectives as well as forward-looking, utopian visions of accounting, focusing
                                    especially on Brazil and Latin-America. Not only history and sociopolitical context,
                                    but also culture and power in/around organizations have been underexplored in the
                                    accounting literature although even a reasonable rationale acknowledges that they
                                    should be influential factors in molding and building the accounting phenomena
                                    (Hines, 1988).<br />
                                    Critical viewpoints in international accounting literature are rather plural and
                                    diverse. They seek to challenge the conventional wisdom on financial and
                                    non-financial practices and create spaces for alternative voices and contributions
                                    to public policies. Therefore, the stream proposes to embrace researchers that
                                    perceive accounting as a mechanism, a discourse, a structure or a practice that
                                    contributes to the advancement of contemporary neoliberalism and sustains new forms
                                    of dominance or neocolonial invisible violence in countries in the margins. <br />
                                    Interdisciplinarity is a fundamental aspect to make transparent the role that
                                    accounting plays in reducing social welfare and deepening social inequalities.
                                    Hence, it is necessary to deal with alternative ways in which accounting, and
                                    accountability can potentially lead to enhanced societal welfare while challenging
                                    Western traditional economic and developmental models. <br />
                                    Therefore, the proposed theme (CRIAS) invites researchers to submit historical and
                                    contemporary critical studies that are related to managerial accounting, auditing,
                                    financial markets and accounting frameworks, regulations, governance and public
                                    accountability. In particular, CRIAS provides an interface between developments in
                                    critical and interpretive management studies, possibilities for new practices,
                                    knowledge and forms of accountability. Contributions are welcomed from a variety of
                                    theoretical, methodological and philosophical traditions related to critical and
                                    interpretive paradigms, based on qualitative approaches to research. Scholars,
                                    students and early-career researchers are most welcomed as presenters and
                                    participants.<br />

                                    Cities have increasingly become of interest to Organization Studies, building on the
                                    solid academic output on the urban space already present in the fields of
                                    Architecture and Urbanism, Geography, Urban Sociology, Urban Anthropology and more
                                    recently, in Public Administration. In the latter, there are great concerns about
                                    city management in terms of governance, regulations, participation, organization of
                                    collective spaces, etc. However, as a confluence of physical spatial structures,
                                    rules and rights, actors, networks and knowledge, cultures and differences, design
                                    and technologies, the city has become an increasingly important agenda for
                                    researchers in several areas of knowledge, including Organization Studies. Within
                                    the scope of this proposal and continuing the successful of the previous topic of
                                    interest, we highlight three aspects related to the relationship between City and
                                    Organization Studies: the historical perspective, which gives the city a specific
                                    reference point located in time and in the construction of urban spaces of history
                                    and memory; the creative and economic perspective, in which management is
                                    highlighted as a central aspect; and the margin perspective that houses multiple
                                    beams associated to knowledges and existence peripherally produced, and “on the
                                    margins” of what is regarded as hegemonic and therefore visible.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    We invite researchers to present papers for this thematic grouping of topics based
                                    on several epistemological and methodological positions that have as axes Cities and

                                    Since its inception, universities have been subjected to processes of transformation
                                    and movements that put their reasons for being in check. Efforts to justify its
                                    relevance have required a capacity for reconfiguration, preserving original
                                    responsibilities and suggesting new challenges. However, the university's
                                    historiography allows us to affirm that its transformations were never able to fully
                                    satisfy social expectations. In view of the centrality of an institution whose
                                    commitments go beyond the fields of teaching, research and extension, it is intended
                                    to encourage debate about the university. In this sense, some questions, from the
                                    most comprehensive to the most contextualized, are opportune:<br />
                                    Why and how to preserve higher education as a universal human right, recognized as a
                                    social necessity and duty of States?<br />
                                    What to understand by university autonomy and academic freedom?<br />
                                    What are the ethical and political limits of the university as we know it?<br />
                                    What elements define an institution with such a wide range of outlines and
                                    meanings?<br />
                                    Is contemporary university management compatible with the changes experienced by
                                    society?<br />
                                    How to protect the university from commercialism, corporatism and denialism?<br />
                                    During and after the pandemic, what were and what could be the university's
                                    contributions to the new normal?<br />
                                    What is the relationship between the hegemonic model of internationalization and the
                                    unequal geopolitics of knowledge?<br />
                                    What are the consequences of the intensification of competition between
                                    universities, whether due to recognition in exogenous rankings, professors and
                                    productive / promising students or sources of funding?<br />
                                    In the face of budgetary constraints, how can standards of excellence be achieved in
                                    terms of knowledge production and dissemination?<br />
                                    What are the university's responsibilities regarding the process of social inclusion
                                    and the reduction of inequalities?<br />
                                    What are the university's dysfunctionalities and areas of obsolescence when
                                    considering the purposes and destinations of knowledge; interdisciplinarity; the
                                    relationship between education and citizen training and the democratization of
                                    access (allied to the challenges of permanence students)?<br />
                                    What roles can Technical-Administrative Servants in Education play in university
                                    management and core activities, notably in research and extension?<br />
                                    What is possible to learn from university architectures and new institutional
                                    arrangements created from the Program for Restructuring and Expansion of Brazilian
                                    Federal Universities (REUNI)?<br />
                                    After all, keeping in mind the international context, but problematizing national
                                    dilemmas, conditions and urgencies, which university do we want and for whom?<br />
                                    The focus of this theme is, therefore, on productions that consider the university
                                    as an institution in constant transformation. The texts are expected to favor the
                                    understanding of deliberate and / or emerging paths for the network of higher
                                    education institutions in times of growing demands, scarcity of means and
                                    uncertainties - enhanced by new social relations, production and communication
                                    technologies and post-pandemic health restrictions. In this sense, priority is given
                                    to studies on the public sphere of education, translated into bold and socially
                                    relevant university projects, supported by critical and propositional
                                    theoretical-methodological approaches, focused on the teaching, research and
                                    extension triad, but also on university management.

                                    The present work group aims to promote, visualize and articulate researches on
                                    organizational practices that break, destabilize or open gaps and fissures to the
                                    neoliberal work logic, especially those referring to the universe of what is said
                                    "popular": business, commerce, arts, parties, informal economies, people`s invisible
                                    things that somehow resist the globalized world system.<br />
                                    We propose to encourage reflection on the processes of production and organization
                                    of different spaces, knowledge and powers: the house, the street, the city, groups,
                                    popular organizations. The gaze turns to the other ways of existing and organizing
                                    that are often ignored or actively invisible within a mainstream of management and
                                    that constitute multiple possibilities of breaking with totalizing thoughts and
                                    practices in the area.<br />
                                    At a time when devices and machinery of power seek to control and give life a unique
                                    shape amid global capitalism the resistance intensifies precisely on the forms of
                                    life, survival and creation of other ways of being and organizing that escape, slip
                                    and invert the rules of the game (FOUCAULT, 2017, LAZZARATO, 2014). In this
                                    scenario, as indicated by Pelbart (2000, 2003, 2016), mapping other modes of
                                    existence becomes a relevant project, emphasizing multiplicities that do not allow
                                    to be encompassed by the totalizing machinery of power. In Organizational Studies,
                                    other ways of organizing that constantly survive and recreate themselves in everyday
                                    life form a reservoir of lesser knowledges and potentialities for overcoming the
                                    status quo.<br />
                                    In this way, we propose to contribute to a possible "fenomenologia da dispersão
                                    anárquica do poder" (FOUCAULT, 1998, p.48). By means of smaller, local, every day,
                                    popular, even if specific and singular, sometimes also temporary management
                                    experiences, we intend to find, map and share clues, detours, escape routes and
                                    expand the possibilities of doing, knowing and power of our space and organizational
                                    time, to amplify the power of contestation and creation (BENJAMIN, 1984), which
                                    inaugurates the new in the face of the logic and devices of power inherent to
                                    individualizing neoliberalism.<br />

                                    practice. Epistemology is inserted as a specific discipline, or as a particular
                                    topic of discussion in most curricula of the Graduate Programs in Administration.
                                    Epistemology is also a central theme of scientific events, as in the case of the
                                    International Colloquium on Epistemology and Sociology of Science in Administration,
                                    and several times it has already received editions entirely dedicated to its
                                    discussion from periodicals in the area. Within the scope of ANPAD, the Theme was
                                    created in 2009, in the Division of Teaching and Research in Administration and
                                    Accounting (EPQ), and, in 2010, in the Division of Organizational Studies (EOR). As
                                    a methodical and reflective study of knowledge, of its organization, of its
                                    formation, of its development, of its functioning and of its products, epistemology
                                    occupies an extremely important place for the critical examination of our own
                                    production of sciences and knowledge, helping us, thus, in making critical awareness
                                    of our daily practice.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    For the EOR Division, the proposal is that the theme is dedicated to epistemology in
                                    organizational studies and seeks to focus the reflection on the production of
                                    knowledge and scientific knowledge of organizational and administrative phenomena,
                                    as well as to discuss the social conditions of production of this knowledge, always
                                    with in order to promote dialogues between epistemologies and disciplines. With
                                    these objectives, the theme contemplates the diverse epistemic approaches
                                    (positivism, functionalism, structuralism, institutionalism, interpretativism,
                                    critical theory, marxism, pragmatism, post-structuralism, critical realism,
                                    post-criticism, among others), from contributions of disciplines such as
                                    administration, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, history, semiotics and
                                    psychoanalysis. Ontology and methodology can be approached, but from the
                                    articulation of these with the epistemologies, building principles, arguments,
                                    hypotheses, procedures, results, interpretations and practices to critically analyze
                                    the different epistemological approaches or currents. In addition, the social and
                                    organizational conditions of scientific production - the so-called scientific field
                                    - can also be discussed in an articulated way to epistemology, because in addition
                                    to the epistemological development having a strong influence of these conditions,
                                    the Graduate Programs train professors and researchers to act in a field that needs
                                    to be discussed scientifically at ENANPAD for its own evolution.<br />

                                    theme of Learning and Knowledge, especially those that refers to organizations. We
                                    are interested in understanding the processes of learning processes through the
                                    transdisciplinary dialogue of areas of knowledge such as Sociology, Anthropology,
                                    Psychology and Education. This intersection broadens the understanding of learning
                                    in organizations, their actors, methodological movements, political dimension, as
                                    well as knowledge that is constituted by and in organizational processes. <br />
                                    The widening of the locus of learning in other socially organized spaces is needed,
                                    proving to be essential to know and recognize actors who interact with and in these
                                    organizations. It is intended to reflect on the knowledge in different contexts of
                                    exclusion and socioeconomic inequalities.<br />
                                    The expansion proposed here, considering the nature of organizations as
                                    organizational processes is to go beyond the hegemonic understanding that productive
                                    organization is the only space of learning occurrence, because we consider the
                                    social movements; popular, social, public, and non-governmental organizations; the
                                    collectives; the physical and virtual networks, among others, also as place of
                                    expression of learning. Of the nature of the actors, those of different territorial
                                    belongings, those of different urbanities and ruralities, those of different
                                    ethnic-racial flags, gender and sexual diversity, religious, cultural and language
                                    belonging, are ways of considering the political gap of learning studies in
                                    organizations.<br />
                                    The proposal seeks to give visibility, criticism and spaces of manifestation to the
                                    collective actors that are usually invisible. This also implies discussing
                                    methodological alternatives to develop such studies.<br />
                                    Topics we would like to discuss (but not limited to):<br />
                                    • How knowledge is constituted by and within the organizational processes?<br />
                                    • What is the implication of understanding the political dimension of practices for
                                    the construction of knowledge?<br />
                                    • How new organizational forms and employment arrangements (temporary and contingent
                                    work, intermediaries, network-based enterprises, etc.) influence the distribution of
                                    power and inequalities in the workplace and labour markets?<br />
                                    • How are established the (changeable) relations between social participation and
                                    segregation? And how does this impact on the work, professions and learning
                                    dimension?<br />
                                    • How the knowledges of science, politics, natural history and native peoples help
                                    us to think and create collective modes of resistance?<br />
                                    • How do emerging information and technologies (online platforms, algorithms,
                                    machine learning, predictive analytics, etc.) shape screening, hiring, task
                                    allocation, and consequently workplace learning?<br />
                                    • How the emergent of new technologies redefine the nature of work by creating new
                                    identities, professions, and communities? And in this context, what and how are
                                    generated new discourses that limit the professions, work and the constitution of
                                    knowledge?<br />
                                    • What are the (unintended) consequences of old and new organizational practices and
                                    routines, particularly why they benefit some individuals or groups while restricting
                                    opportunities for others inside and outside of work organizations?<br />
                                    • Where are social research methods being invented? What are possible alternative
                                    spaces to hegemonic knowledge systems of knowledge?<br />
                                    • What is the critical and transformative potential of research methods on learning
                                    and knowledge?<br />
                                    • What knowledge and practices involve the constitution of the subject that
                                    reflects, transforms and codifies scientific and research work?<br />
                                    <br />

                                    The political-social role played by companies has gained the attention of authors in
                                    organizational studies with the themes of entrepreneurship (Battilana, Leca, &
                                    Boxenbaum, 2009), leadership (Yuan & Woodman, 2010) and human rights (Barros, 2018).
                                    Some studies have already studied corruption and the direct relationship with the
                                    private sector (Collins, Uhlenbruck, & Rodriguez, 2009; Chowdhury, Audretsch, &
                                    Belitski, 2015). This is due to recent corruption scandals (Coelho & Barros, 2020),
                                    as well as crimes and environmental disasters (Pereira, Barros & Rezende, 2020).
                                    Thus, it is important to better understand the role played by organizations and
                                    their respective accountability. Recent research has explored the need and failure
                                    of corporate governance policies, integrity/compliance programs (Aldeguer et al.
                                    2020; Couto & Carrieri, 2020; Zattoni & Cuomo, 2008) and corporate social
                                    responsibility (Bansal, & Song, 2017).<br />
                                    Many organizations use the importance given to their social function to create codes
                                    of ethics, voluntary and “humanitarian” actions, as well as marketing campaigns that
                                    improve their image (Zattoni & Cuomo, 2008). These macroprocesses are influenced by
                                    the institutional environment and by phenomena such as isomorphism (DiMaggio &
                                    Powell, 1983), but they also function as a bargaining chip for the generation of
                                    legitimacy (Suchman, 1995). <br />
                                    This positive trend is obscured by the evidence that shows the formation of "a
                                    facade of responsibility" (Meyer & Rowan, 1977, Zylbersztajn, 2002). At the same
                                    time that they disclose their social actions, organizations are concealing
                                    irresponsible and even illegal actions such as corruption, corporate crimes,

                                    unethical behaviors (Costa & Borin, 2018).<br />
                                    In a broad way, this theme seeks to analyze: a) how do companies act politically? b)
                                    how is corporate and CEO activism exercised and what are its social impacts? c) what
                                    are your unethical behaviors? d) What about the instruments to fight them?<br />

                                    and theoretical approaches that discuss the social and political function of
                                    organizations are welcome. Papers may include, but are not limited to, the following

                                    Technological innovations, as tools of neoliberalism, have produced a new economic
                                    and social order based on veiled practices of data extraction, prediction and
                                    sales.<br />
                                    This exploitation of data allows the maximization of organizations' profits and
                                    enhances the expropriation of rights and the capture of human experiences,
                                    consolidating itself as a new form of power and colonialism - data colonialism.
                                    These new technologies, called intelligent, are based on a discourse of
                                    technological solutions, indispensable for the growth and productivity of
                                    organizations. In this context, some research has pointed to a culture of
                                    surveillance that produces a society and a sentinel state. There is a strong demand
                                    for the prediction of the subjects' behaviors, and the installation of a persuasive
                                    paradigm, based on the induction of behaviors and decisions, not always conscious.
                                    This technological rationality is reproduced in different instances of social life.
                                    In the scope of labor relations, while discussing the prospects of replacing the
                                    workforce with machines, it is not possible to disregard the profound
                                    reconfiguration of labor relations based on digitalization. Algorithmic management
                                    has allowed physical dispersion and disarticulation of workers, as well as detailed
                                    control of each individual's actions. In parallel, technologies, especially digital,
                                    are not simple functional devices. They are built on human beliefs and logic and
                                    have no axiological neutrality, in essence they have organizational interests
                                    constituted in the form of digital tools. As a result, the use of these tools has
                                    had the side effect of accentuating the (re) production of inequality, exclusion and
                                    social discrimination. To problematize the ethics of digital technologies, revealing
                                    their predispositions to (re) produce privileges and their commitments to maintain
                                    hegemonic status, becomes a necessary agenda that contributes to the discussion of
                                    discrimination by gender, race, among other important issues denounced in social
                                    relations. In this sense, it is essential to open spaces for the perspectives of
                                    power and technological resistance, analyzing: i. the asymmetries of power relations
                                    between users of digital platforms and the organizations that operate them; ii. the
                                    role of the State in mediating and controlling these relationships; iii. the growing
                                    organizational phenomena based on the actions of techno-activists; and iv. new
                                    ethical perspectives based on the subjects' creativity, such as hackers, who seek to
                                    subvert this new form of socio-digital domination, through their own networks and
                                    social media. The call aims to bring together plural approaches and methods, and
                                    aims to instigate the development of research on the digitized world and
                                    organizational studies. For this, six main themes are proposed:<br />
                                    1) Surveillance capitalism, data colonialism and algorithmic mediation;<br />
                                    2) Digitized work, surveillance culture and algorithm management;<br />
                                    3) Digitization as a tool for inequality, exclusion and discrimination (social,
                                    racial, gender positions, among others);<br />
                                    4) Power and techno resistance;<br />
                                    5) The articulations of the discourse of digital technology;<br />
                                    6) The relationship between digitization and atypical contexts, such as the
                                    consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its repercussions on and by digital
                                    technologies.

                                    The Anthropocene is as a new geological epoch marked by the impacts that we humans
                                    have on the so-called Earth-System, exploring natural limits and shaping the
                                    planet's surface in a way comparable to the land-based forces themselves (STEFFEN ET
                                    AL, 2015). Thus, this theme aims to bring together and foster debates that call into
                                    question scientific thinking in Management and Organizational Studies about
                                    organized relationships among the different actors and subjects of the Anthropocene
                                    (whether they are human and / or non-human) as well as the interactions and
                                    conflicts that arise from these relationships.<br />
                                    On the one hand, we want to invite the academic community to the challenge of
                                    thinking about the limits and weaknesses of the modes of capitalist development
                                    that, through destructive organizational practices (ERGENE, BANERJEE AND HOFFMAN,
                                    2020; BANERJEE, 2008), have been producing interactions with other ways of being in
                                    the world, which result in sanitary, economic and socio-environmental crises and
                                    catastrophes. We also want to reunite discussions about inequalities produced by the
                                    political economy that sustains the Anthropocene and produces the growing conflicts
                                    over the appropriation of nature. Such conflicts involve a multiplicity of actors,
                                    their political agendas and different organizational forms arranged in territories
                                    marked by struggles, vulnerabilities and extractive, industrial, rural exploitation,
                                    among others. In this way, we seek works in Organizational Studies that contemplate
                                    the different social groups impacted by such processes.<br />
                                    On the other hand, when we understand the field based on troubles, concerns and
                                    criticisms based on the so-called “human exceptionalism”, marked by anthropocentric
                                    and speciesist perspectives that characterize Western thought and hegemonic
                                    scientific approaches, we invite those interested to exercise critical reflections
                                    on possible alternatives for thinking about the very coexistence of humans and
                                    non-humans in the Anthropocene / Capitalocene, based on a concern with the biosocial
                                    dimension of organizing (LABATUT; MUNRO; DESMOND, 2016), making room for
                                    multispecies perspectives in Organizational Studies (FANTINEL, 2020). We try to open
                                    space for reflections that put organizing in perspective based on more than human
                                    policies (BEACHAM, 2018). We understand that the Anthropocene highlights the crisis
                                    of modern paradigms and that it can provide the articulation of new lenses to think
                                    about living well and living with others, in an integrative perspective of the
                                    beings of nature against the effects of capitalism (ERGENE; CALÁS; SMIRCICH, 2018).
                                    The scope of this perspective makes it possible to question the limits of
                                    traditional dualistic ontologies that mark the production of knowledge. In addition,
                                    the Anthropocene brings the need to revise northern epistemologies and openness to
                                    decoloniality (DAVIS; TODD, 2017; QUIJANO, 2011).

                                    This theme aims to address social inequalities produced at work and in
                                    organizations, considering especially race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, and
                                    territory. We welcome studies developed from an intersectional approach. This
                                    approach accounts for how differences turn into social inequalities and how they
                                    articulate in organizations, leading to particular mechanisms of privilege. These
                                    issues have gained academic and political prominence due to the growing concern
                                    about creating democratic and inclusive workplaces, management practices, and
                                    organizations. Therefore, we invite studies on power relations and dynamics, which
                                    stress the political dimension of differences in ideological, historical, social,
                                    and cultural terms. We adopt a broad concept of work, including debates on the
                                    productive and reproductive work, organizations, management, and public and private
                                    administration. Additionally, the notion of organization comprises public and
                                    private agents, non-governmental organizations, associations, organizations of
                                    social movements, among other organizational dimensions of social life. We also
                                    encourage studies on how social inequalities have been constructed and reproduced in
                                    the workplace, especially in an articulated manner, focusing both on groups socially
                                    privileged (e.g., men and masculinities, white people, socioeconomic elites,
                                    privileged immigrants, heterosexuals, non-disabled people, etc.) and historically
                                    discriminated (e.g., women, black people, workers, discriminated immigrants,
                                    refugees, indigenous, quilombolas, LGBTQI+, disabled people, reflections upon
                                    territorial and regional inequalities, etc.). This debate includes analyses of
                                    social inequalities in the national and international labor market; the action of
                                    the state, social movements, and intergovernmental organizations in denouncing or
                                    coping with discrimination and exclusion; and case studies about how organizations
                                    face particular experiences of inequality in the workplace, as well as the
                                    management practices developed to tackle inequalities. It also includes research on
                                    the social, sexual, and racial division of work, considering the relationship
                                    between productive and reproductive work. Therefore, themes such as care,
                                    professional and nonprofessional care, care of specific groups, and policies to
                                    articulate work and family, among others, are stressed. In line with this, we
                                    welcome analyses of public policies focusing on discriminated groups and/or to
                                    promote social equality. Finally, we encourage discussion on epistemological,
                                    theoretical, and methodological perspectives to approach these issues, as well as
                                    studies that evidence a new research agenda and explore other axes of oppression not
                                    explicitly mentioned in this proposal.<br />

                                    The historical turn in management and organization studies was consolidated from the
                                    2000s (Mills et al., 2016). It created a diverse epistemic community, which was
                                    consolidated around discussions about the past and how to write history for the
                                    present (Coraiola & Murcia, 2020; Decker et al., 2020). Such a community can already
                                    be considered consolidated both in Brazil and abroad (Costa et al., 2010).<br />
                                    This theme encompasses historical research exploring the political, economic, and
                                    psychosocial relationships established between subjects, organizations, and
                                    societies. We hope to have submissions that contemplate such relationships in any
                                    geographic-temporal space from any theoretical and methodological approaches (e.g.,
                                    Wanderley & Barros, 2019).<br />
                                    As for "organizations", this concept is widely understood. It includes, for example,
                                    social movements, everyday life at work, family or educational organizations. In
                                    short, the concept goes beyond the firm and should reflect the specificities of each
                                    form of organization.<br />
                                    We expect manuscripts using the biographical method or life history in its various
                                    historical and psychosocial approaches (Granato et al., 2020). We highlight the
                                    relevance of people's experience over time and the understanding of the subjects'
                                    representations about history, in a broader way, and in relation to their life
                                    history. It is the record of individual and collective memories (Rowlinson et al.,
                                    2010), of experiences and trajectories (re)told aiming at transforming,
                                    emancipating, or giving visibility to collectivities, subjects, and their
                                    experiences.<br />
                                    With regard to the theoretical approach, we expect the rescue of classics of
                                    Brazilian social thought (Wanderley, 2016), as well as themes that structure
                                    Brazil's social reality (Wanderley & A. Barros, 2019), such as the role of slavery
                                    and other characteristics that framed it the country's development (A. Barros &
                                    Wanderley, 2020). We are also looking forward to works that focus on concepts dear
                                    to history or memory (Granato et al., 2020). Equally for psychosociology theorists,
                                    among other aspects, which deal with biographies, history, life history, and
                                    experience (V. Barros and Lopes, 2014).<br />
                                    We invite you to submit theoretical and empirical works that focus on the basis of
                                    new sources and objects, ontological, epistemological, or methodological
                                    contributions from the historical perspective to the area of ??organizational
                                    studies.<br />
                                    Studies are welcome that:<br />
                                    - Analyze how sources and historical archives contribute to understanding
                                    organizational phenomena and their articulation with the social and political;<br />
                                    - Stimulate debates on historical research in administration and organizational

                                    - Discuss the uses of the past in organizational studies and investigate how
                                    organizations instrumentalize their past by creating and managing their collections
                                    and documentary archives, producing meanings from disputes between official memories
                                    and silenced memories;<br />
                                    - Are based on sources such as public, private, or business archives,
                                    advertisements, periodicals, films, documentaries, etc;<br />
                                    - Use the theoretical and methodological approaches of Life History or Oral History,
                                    in which the following stand out: the centrality in the subject and in their lived
                                    experience, the importance of orality, the valorization of individual and social
                                    memory for the understanding of organizations, work, and society;<br />
                                    - Rescue the relations between public education policies, education organizations,
                                    and Administration disciplines.

                                    This thematic proposal aims to contribute to Organizational Studies by demystifying
                                    the concept of “work" as restricted to the so-called “productive” sphere.
                                    Additionally, we point to the potential contribution of the theory on social
                                    reproduction to a materialist, feminist, anti-racist, and decolonial understanding
                                    of organizational, educational, and social changes taking place in the context of
                                    contemporary neoliberalism. By approaching this thematic, we hope to give visibility
                                    to the female, undervalued work, in the terms of Jules Falquet, carried out by
                                    impoverished, racialized, and proletarianized women who, around the globe, carry out
                                    poorly (or unpaid) reproductive work. This, also called "domestic work" is a set of
                                    activities of a physical, emotional, and sexual nature through which women guarantee
                                    the existence and maintenance of capitalism through social reproduction. Silvia
                                    Federici conceives social reproduction in a double sense: as the reproduction of
                                    exploited labor, through the birth, sustenance, and education of children who will
                                    make up the future proletariat, as well as through the work carried out (mainly) by
                                    women at home, ensuring that working-class (especially men) can return to the next
                                    day's capitalist exploitation. In this way, social reproduction is the material
                                    basis of patriarchy culture. As Heleieth Saffioti explains, patriarchal culture is
                                    discarded as the ultimate source of explanation for discrimination against women
                                    under capitalism. From the unitary theory perspective, as explained by Cinzia
                                    Arruzza, we understand the relations that generate oppression of gender, class, and
                                    race as integral elements of capitalist society that, throughout historical
                                    processes, dissolved previous forms of social life to meet the needs of the ruling
                                    classes in each context. In a period of a global economic crisis in which the
                                    neoliberal speculative fury accentuates the ideological dictates of fiscal austerity
                                    and budget cuts of public policies essential to social reproduction, there is full
                                    compatibility between economic liberalism and moral conservatism. The worldwide
                                    advance of discourses against women, the black population, indigenous people, and
                                    the LGBTQIA + community serve as an ideological varnish to push more and more
                                    racialized and impoverished women into underpaid (or unpaid) domestic work,
                                    responding to the concrete importance of reproductive work for owners of the means
                                    of production, which stopped being financed collectively via the State by social
                                    policies to be assumed in the (supposed) private sphere of the home. The thematical
                                    proposal, in this sense, aims to promote and discuss academic papers with themes
                                    such as the romanticization of motherhood, reproductive control, domestic work,
                                    reproductive control, access and conditions for women to remain in school,
                                    reinforcement of gender stereotypes, the genocide of populations indigenous peoples
                                    and black youth, advancing colonized liberal practices and discourses, increasing
                                    the mass incarceration of racialized and proletarianized people (especially women)
                                    around the globe and who therefore constitute criticisms of poverty management
                                    instruments used to mask the need in the current neoliberal context to push
                                    racialized and proletarianized people (especially women) into compulsory
                                    reproductive work and/or imprisonment, to mask the essentially predatory and
                                    discriminatory face of the social order.

                                    The world we are used to living in is changing, just as our parameters for what is
                                    considered normal. Most of these changes arise from the global perception of the
                                    need to face the grand societal challenges that present themselves in this scenario
                                    (Ferraro et al., 2015; George et al., 2016). Thus, we experience major challenges,
                                    such as the production of vaccines against the Covid19; problems in the
                                    organizational networks involved in climate change solution; the regulation of
                                    individual information on networks; the criticism of economic models that exclude
                                    diversity; the difficulties of Latin American countries in contributing to the
                                    achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals proposed by the 2030 Agenda of the
                                    United Nations.<br />
                                    Organizational practices are understood as the construction, decision and actual
                                    actions related to alliances, agreements, conflict resolution, manifestations of
                                    power, processes of discussion and negotiation of norms and rules, presence of
                                    formal and informal governance; formation of the bond structure, legitimization and
                                    institutionalization of the groups' operation mode (Hinings, Logue, & Zietsma, 2017;
                                    Ocasio, Thornton, & Lounsbury, 2017). In the same way, it is understood that
                                    theories of social construction assume that social actors are those who configure
                                    social and organizational reality through their practices and rules. At the same
                                    time, this reality constructed through practices and rules guide social actors'
                                    actions. These theories understand that the construction process involves different
                                    conditions such as collaboration, negotiation between the actors, or even
                                    imposition. Eventually, the relationship between the actors can result in conflicts,
                                    which may or may not imply changes in practices, rules and organizational
                                    configurations (Goodrick & Reay, 2011; Nicolini et al., 2016; Raynard, 2016).<br />
                                    Thus, based on the notion that facing major societal challenges requires major
                                    social changes and that they are not possible without the engagement of
                                    organizations (Ferraro et al., 2015; George et al., 2016), this theme proposes that
                                    such issues shall be discussed from the transition from a functional vision and
                                    based on individual projects to a vision that allows understanding the role of
                                    organizations and organizational practices in the social construction of a new
                                    reality that is urgent from the solution of these great challenges (Manders,
                                    Wieczorek, & Verbong, 2018).<br />
                                    This theme has both theoretical and empirical relevance, given the growing academic
                                    and managerial interest in the search for answers to the great societal challenges
                                    by organizations (van Wijk et al., 2013). However, questions related to the
                                    multiplicity and heterogeneity of actors and organizational practices involved in
                                    collective action (Grodal & O’Mahony, 2017) in search of answers to major societal
                                    challenges still need to be better explained. Thus, the presentation of cases or
                                    reflections that investigate these themes based on theories of social construction
                                    that have emerged in recent decades are encouraged, such as sociological
                                    institutionalism, relational view, social analysis of networks, policy networks,
                                    ecosystems, collective innovation, in sum, theories that deal with the social
                                    processes of decision and collective action.<br />

                                    Different markets and their processes, such as competition, cooperation, risk,
                                    evaluation and valuation, impact organizations, their strategies, structures and
                                    governance. Power, politics, morality, laws and interests are also relevant aspects
                                    for understanding the construction of markets and how organizations relate to it. In
                                    addition, institutional diversity is strongly influenced by economic agents. Taking
                                    these phenomena into consideration, Economic Sociology is one of the areas that has
                                    contributed the most and still has great potential to stimulate new theorizations in
                                    the field of Organizational Studies. This branch of sociology has broadened the
                                    understanding of economic action, mainly by transposing the rationalist assumptions
                                    of Traditional Economic Theory and privileging cultural, social, cognitive and
                                    political aspects in the dynamics of markets and organizations. We understand that
                                    the distinctive character of Economic Sociology, among so many other theories in
                                    Organizational Studies, is the concept of socially embedded economic action and its
                                    relationship with markets, organizations and institutions. Therefore, with the
                                    objective of deepening knowledge in the area of Organizational Studies about the
                                    relationship between Markets, Organizations and Institutions, we welcome empirical

                                    The teaching case is a type of approach that encompass a report of a situation
                                    experienced by a professional, a private, public or third sector organization, or a
                                    specific project of practical and / or social nature, which presents a dilemma to be
                                    analyzed in the context of undergraduate or graduate education. Thus, the case
                                    method subsidizes the decision-making process, providing the opportunity for greater
                                    integration between theory and practice. The main objective is educational and
                                    learning-oriented and the development of subject-specific skills (Alberton e Silva,
                                    2018).<br />
                                    Between 2007 and 2018, ANPAD events published 277 teaching cases. The quantitative
                                    is significant, since in the last four years 117 cases have been published, which is
                                    equivalent to 42.24% of the case publications of the last 10 years, indicating a
                                    perspective of growth by the modality. The number of journals that publish cases for
                                    teaching has also increased significantly, and there are already more than 20
                                    magazines that publish them regularly.<br />
                                    Some characteristics of a good teaching case include the clarity of the objective
                                    and dilemma, its contribution to the area of management knowledge and the context in
                                    which it was developed, as well as the author's impartiality in presenting the case,
                                    the provision of information. Incidents or dialogues covering the context,
                                    background, agents involved and the dilemma, as well as the quality of teaching
                                    notes (Alberton e Silva, 2018).<br />
                                    The format of a teaching case is very specific. It is a single 8 to 16 page document
                                    organized into two major sections - case description (narrative) and teaching
                                    notes.<br />
                                    The teaching notes are fundamental because they aim to guide the teacher in the
                                    analysis of the case in the educational context, either undergraduate or
                                    postgraduate.<br />
                                    The case analysis should be presented exclusively in the teaching notes, through
                                    discussion questions that offer “possible answers” (quantitative and / or
                                    qualitative) - supported by references of the literature - for each of the questions
                                    proposed. In other words, teaching notes should not have a literature review
                                    section. References to the literature should be made while articulating the answers
                                    to the questions.<br />
                                    Also, simply suggesting a set of discussion questions is not a sufficient condition
                                    for teaching notes. Each proposed question requires a careful analysis supported by
                                    the literature.’<br />
                                    The teaching case positioning is very relevant. Case authors should clearly state
                                    the academic objectives of the case, the issue (fundamental issue), the discipline
                                    (course), and the program level (undergraduate or graduate) where the case could be
                                    applied. In other words, a case that suits everyone and everything will not be
                                    adopted by anyone.<br />

                                    The promotion of innovative educational initiatives oriented to sustainability and
                                    spirituality has occurred in three instances: institutional, organizational, and
                                    didactic-pedagogical. At the institutional level, since the 1970s, Conferences,
                                    Letters, and Declarations of principles established by intergovernmental and
                                    international bodies and agencies, such as the UN, have contributed to the
                                    dissemination and institutionalization of sustainability in education. In Brazil, in
                                    the late 1990s, the sustainability theme became mandatory in higher education (Law
                                    9795/1999). In parallel, from the 1990s, the development of the study of
                                    spirituality in organizations took shape, mainly with the support of the MSR
                                    (Management, Spirituality, and Religion) group at the Academy of Management (USA).
                                    The MSR explores how spirituality can influence organizational dynamics and affect
                                    management results, seeking to understand the meaning of work better, the impact of
                                    spirituality and spiritual leadership in the workplace, the purpose of business and
                                    the distinctive elements of spiritual aspects, or even religious, individual. More
                                    recently, in 2015, after the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals
                                    publication, education for sustainability and spirituality gained even more strength
                                    as they are fundamental to achieve the proposed objectives. The responsibility of
                                    Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) is to translate global goals into studies and
                                    learning experiences that encourage the training of responsible and conscientious
                                    professionals. Initiatives related to curricular and co-curricular experiences,
                                    pedagogical experimentation, active and innovative methodologies, on-campus and
                                    off-campus management and impact are fundamental for developing professionals
                                    prepared to deal with the socio-economic and environmental challenges of the society
                                    in which we live. In this sense, the theme proposed here is dedicated to exploring
                                    innovative experiences of HEIs and teacher-researchers in education for
                                    sustainability and spirituality in the Administration and Accounting courses. We
                                    believe that encouraging research in this area is fundamental for the greater
                                    dissemination of acceptable practices that can be applied and replicated by HEIs to
                                    expand education's social impact.<br />

                                    Design Science and Design Science Research have developed in different areas of
                                    management, including Information Systems and Operations Management, for example.
                                    Recently, the Journal of Operations Management opened a department to advance
                                    methodological knowledge and encourage research using this method.<br />
                                    <br />

                                    artifacts for the improvement of Brazilian organizations is timely and necessary for
                                    the advancement of society. Currently, we see a high concern in Professional Masters
                                    and Doctorates to generate technological products. These products can be considered
                                    artifacts.<br />

                                    The professional practice of management and accounting and scientific research in
                                    academic life are seen here as knowledge-intensive situations, and thus, their
                                    teaching and education should highlight the analysis of their fundamentals and
                                    epistemological and methodological dimensions.<br />
                                    The classic concepts of Episthemê, Téchnê and Phrónesis are used as reference,
                                    forming a trilogy that favored the unity of human knowledge, which governs action
                                    and decision, implying prudence, and direct learning through experience. <br />
                                    However, the post-Aristotelian Western tradition concealed prestige and space in the
                                    school institutions, to analytical and abstract reasoning knowledge, the Episthemic
                                    one, splitting it from the practical knowledge of the course of action (Phrónesis)
                                    and the ability knowledge-in the construction of every order artifacts (Téchnê), an
                                    instrumental knowledge, be it mechanical or mental (the calculus).<br />
                                    Taken to the extreme of rationalism the epistemic knowledge has been the basis of
                                    our higher education, adding to it- but never adequately integrating it to the
                                    technical-instrumental knowledge. And the phronetic knowledge, which is refractory
                                    to exhaustive conceptual analysis, even though omnipresent in every business,
                                    policy, school education and even in the scientific enterprise, has been upheld
                                    outside the field of interest and research.<br />
                                    The return to practice as a focus of reflexion evidences divisions in the
                                    conceptions of knowledge, generates the problematic field of this proposed theme
                                    here restricted to the formation and teaching of management, accountancy
                                    professionals and academic management researchers.<br />
                                    The interest in educating brings to the teaching and research environments all the
                                    burden of knowledge situations in future professional´s life, departing from two
                                    perspectives: (i) the epistemic (understanding how they are structured and interfere
                                    in the professional action), and (ii) the pedagogical one (strictu sensu school
                                    institutions in graduate programs and undergraduate level as well), to accomplish
                                    their educational aim.<br />
                                    Research topics of interest such as: <br />
                                    1. (1) value (relevance), conditions and limits of the use of these concepts, given
                                    historical contexts diversity;<br />
                                    2. (2) theory and technology in curricula, considering the presence of Phrónesis in
                                    professional practice, <br />
                                    3. (3) place and value of theoretical research in the area, considering that at
                                    present the instrumental logic confounds Epistheê and Téchnê; <br />
                                    4. (4) Practical wisdom, management of personal knowledge and its implications.
                                    <br />
                                    5. (5) Professional practitioner and research practitioner concerning teaching and
                                    educating management and accountancy as agents of phrónesis;<br />
                                    6. (6) comparative studies between the Brazilian context and other countries
                                    regarding the evolution of knowledge in the field of teaching, developing and
                                    research in managing and accountancy,<br />
                                    7. (7) Epistemology and reflective thinking and reflexivity in training, academic
                                    and practice education and teaching, in management and accountancy. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Reflective studies about researchers, managers, accountants formation, development
                                    and teaching and various forms of knowledge are expected: the epistemic or
                                    theoretical one (contemplative knowledge), technical knowledge based on techné (know
                                    how to do) and the one resulting from phrónesis (knowing how to deliberate in
                                    specific contexts, how and when to act). <br />
                                    By examining the own "nest" (that of the academy and that of the management and
                                    accountancy professionals) guides practitioners to exercise criticism and reflection
                                    about the knowledge they use and produce.

                                    There is a movement towards the dissemination of quality assurance regimes in higher
                                    education in more than half of the countries in the world, whose governments have
                                    implemented certification and compliance systems through the validation of quality
                                    standards (Jarvis, 2014; Croucher, & Woelert, 2016). In Brazil, through Capes, the

                                    improved evaluation system to obtain a national standard of academic excellence
                                    (Capes, 2008). Although the system is considered one of the most modern in the world
                                    (Maccari, Lima, & Riccio, 2009; Nascimento, 2010), there are criticisms, such as,
                                    for example, that the system is standardized for all areas of knowledge, a fact
                                    criticized by Spagnolo and Calhau (2002) who point out the presence of heterogeneity
                                    between different areas of knowledge, as well as diversity regarding economic issues
                                    and access to resources. The evaluation makes it possible to compare performance
                                    between higher education institutions by establishing a ranking, so that the concept
                                    obtained is reflected in the ability to raise funds (Dias Sobrinho, 2003). The
                                    exposed fact has two developments, the first of which points out that higher
                                    education institutions undergo greater accountability and obtain financing based on
                                    performance (Croucher, & Woelert, 2016), causing an increase in organizational
                                    competitiveness. The second implication is institutional isomorphism, which is more
                                    frequently established in a field with high uncertainty and may be associated with
                                    the desire to resemble structures to the most legitimate organizations to increase
                                    the chances of success (Dimaggio, & Powell, 1983). This practice exists almost
                                    naturally among organizations and the greater the tendency to be the more regulated
                                    the organizational field (Peci, 2006). This factor can lead many institutions to
                                    place regulatory standards above their own strategic objectives (Maccari et al.,
                                    2014; Spagnolo & Calhau, 2002). The major implications of isomorphism in an
                                    organizational field such as that of higher education is the generation of barriers
                                    to qualitative advances in science. After this preamble, we suggest the following
                                    topics for the generation of associated research, in order to contribute to the
                                    deepening of the discussion around the theme: a) Institutional evaluation and
                                    quality in Brazilian HEIs; b) Impact of Postgraduate Programs on local, regional and
                                    national development; c) Participation in rankings and the credibility of the
                                    institutions; d) Regulation impacts on institutional legitimacy; e) Pillars of
                                    institutional evaluation; f) Relationship between the means and the purposes of the
                                    evaluation; g) Strategic Planning x regulatory standards; h) Brazilian scientific
                                    internationalization policy; i) The role of evaluation in academic-scientific
                                    expansion; j) Professionalization of management in higher education; l) Competition,
                                    cooperation and compliance in university management; m) Paradox between regionality
                                    and access to resources; n) Bureaucracy and organizational effectiveness; o)
                                    Evaluation and control bodies as guidelines for institutional governance.

                                    It is known that faculties who have graduated from bachelor’s courses do not, in
                                    essence, receive adequate training to carry out their teaching activity in their
                                    undergraduate studies and that post-graduate programs favor research training. Thus,
                                    specifically in the areas of Administration and Accounting, the existence of
                                    didactic-pedagogical semi-training is discussed. The developments of such scenario
                                    are diverse and reflected by the low marks in exams such as the Enade and the
                                    Sufficiency Exam of the Federal Accounting Council, dissatisfaction of students in
                                    class, didactic methodologies that are not innovative and do not develop the
                                    necessary soft skills for a critical and reflective professional. Furthermore, there
                                    is evidence that graduate programs are not preparing faculties to avoid the simple
                                    repetition of content, without adequate epistemological, theoretical, and didactic
                                    training to prepare them to act in the classroom, creating an environment that
                                    favors learning provides support to students. The literature also points out that
                                    post-graduate programs do not offer specific training for academic guidance,
                                    supervision of teaching internships; evaluation of scientific work; management of
                                    universities, among other roles that faculties in the area may assume. It is
                                    essential to point out that such a scenario is not conducive to developing an
                                    Academic Professional Identity, so faculties do not assume themselves as educators
                                    and face the responsibility and complexity involved in teaching practice in its
                                    various facets. Thus, faculties’ understanding of their role as faculties in the
                                    business area is fragmented and superficial, bringing a possible departure from the
                                    profession, the lack of responsibility and commitment to teaching, and a pedagogical
                                    practice that is not adequate current reality. Thus, the proposed theme aims to
                                    disseminate new reflections in the field presented and encourage production and
                                    debate to contribute to the theoretical and empirical development of this scientific
                                    field in order to improve it. Among the topics of interest proposed as a suggestion

                                    strategies with the objective of advancing the discussion of university management,
                                    observing its complexity, atypicality and specificities.<br />
                                    Aspects such as diversity of objectives, highly specialized professionals and the
                                    fact that they have several objectives such as teaching, research, extension and
                                    management, make higher education institutions develop structures, ways of acting
                                    and making their own decisions (BUSCH, 2005; MEYER; LOPES, 2015). Several studies
                                    suggest different models for analyzing university organizations. Contreras and
                                    Mascayano (2018), for example, suggest a new model called New University Governance
                                    to analyze these organizations. Miller, McAdam and McAdam (2014) in their study,
                                    aimed to analyze business models of universities within the United Kingdom, from the
                                    perspective of stakeholders. Navarro and Gallardo (2003) and Tian and Martin (2014)
                                    also present alternative model proposals for university management.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The role of these institutions becomes strategic, as well as their study, since they
                                    are where new generations of professionals and citizens are formed. Therefore,
                                    studies and research that contribute to the advancement of knowledge and responses
                                    to the problems faced by these organizations have repercussions on society as a
                                    whole.<br />
                                    The Coronavirus Pandemic also showed that although the use of technology and the use
                                    of new teaching and learning methods have evolved, in order to improve and qualify
                                    the skills of students and teachers, much remains to be done. In this sense, new
                                    forms of management and teaching / learning experienced during the pandemic can
                                    contribute to studies in the area.<br />
                                    The demand for innovation and knowledge highlights the role of the third mission in
                                    universities, raising questions about the challenges of universities in dealing with
                                    a variety of tasks, including cooperation with industries, transfer of technology
                                    and knowledge, creation of companies and startups (MASCARENHAS et al ., 2017).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    The findings of a recent survey on entrepreneurship and innovation in the
                                    environment of Brazilian universities, promoted by SEBRAE E ENDEAVOR (2017), confirm
                                    that most Brazilian universities are not considered entrepreneurial, opening up
                                    research opportunities on the orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of students
                                    and teachers .<br />

                                    The research methods are dynamic and with permanent development, as they reflect
                                    cultural, social, and technological changes. Therefore, there is a need for
                                    continuous education of researchers. Thus, it is understood as relevant to the
                                    development of research and reflections on the different Research Methods, been
                                    qualitative, quantitative, or mixed. Such research and reflections make it possible
                                    to highlight limitations and potentialities to generate new perspectives for
                                    research in Business and Accounting.<br />

                                    The theme "Behavioral strategy: psychology, sociology, politics and decision-making
                                    in organizations" aims to advance the discussion in the field of human actions that
                                    influence strategic decision-making (Steensen, 2014). The scope of the theme starts
                                    from assumptions arising from the principles of cognitive, behavioral, social and
                                    evolutionary psychology and its diverse applications in processes, agents,
                                    antecedents and consequences of decisions in organizations. In addition, it opens
                                    space for studies involving sociology, anthropology, politics, behavioral economics
                                    and applied neuroscience. Thus, it aims to propose a research space for the
                                    interaction between these theoretical bases, levels of analysis and compatible
                                    methodological approaches (Kline, 2008).<br />
                                    The discussion on the scope of behavioral strategy starts from three views -
                                    limited, intermediate and extended (Hambrick & Crossland, 2018). The first restricts
                                    the behavioral strategy to conflicts between rationality and cognitive biases, a
                                    subject that has gained interest, especially since the 1970s. The intermediate view
                                    assumes that other psychological aspects have an effect on the strategic decision
                                    such as cognition, attention, search, aspirations and, in particular, that the
                                    analysis of the actors and decisions must be interpreted from a dynamic rather than
                                    a static perspective (Dagnino, 2015). The third, extends the limits of behavioral
                                    strategy beyond the individual and opens space for social psychology and its
                                    consequences (sociology, politics, etc.). Thus, it provides studies focusing on team
                                    composition, heterogeneity of decisions, coalitions and conflicts and divergent
                                    interpretations (Augier et al., 2018). Analyzing the composition of studies
                                    submitted to previous versions of this theme, it appears that it is precisely this
                                    expanded view that best reflects the scenario of research on behavioral strategy in
                                    the country.<br />
                                    This way, studies are sought when their contributions include, but are not limited
                                    to, The Upper Echelon Theory, Agency Theory, Corporate Governance, Threat-rigidity,
                                    Adaptation, Attention-based View, TCT, Strategic Inertia, researching the
                                    characteristics of decision-makers and performance, strategic decision-making,
                                    opportunism, resource adaptation, strategy implementation, crisis behavior. In
                                    particular, decision making and other aspects that are influenced by the context.
                                    Research in an institutional context, including the cultural one, such as that of
                                    Brazil, can contribute significantly to the development of the area.<br />
                                    For this iteration of the theme, a more mature process of contributions is sought
                                    (Hoskisson et al., 1999) - based on solid literature, development of clear and
                                    structured hypotheses and propositions and, consequently, contributions of interest
                                    to the discussion in the area (Brinberg & McGrath, 1985; Van de Ven, 2007; Reypens &
                                    Levine, 2018; Jacquard & Jacoby, 2019). In addition to the methods traditionally
                                    used in strategy, there is room for methodological experimentation (mixed methods),
                                    as well as methods that can bring novelty to research in the area - experiments,
                                    neuro/psychological analysis, machine learning and deep learning, among others.

                                    The capacity of the firm's resources stems from its ability to promote the best
                                    trade-off between exploration and exploitation (March, 1991). The understanding of
                                    these two concepts related to the search and application of organizational knowledge
                                    – exploration and exploitation – involves its connection with a wide set of other
                                    elements that are part of its ontological and epistemological model. By specifying
                                    in detail the characteristics relating to the two concepts, it automatically
                                    contributes to the understanding of the third concept derived from both,
                                    ambidexterity. Gupta, Smith, and Shalley (2006), in the analysis of articles
                                    published in the Academy Management Journal in 2006, evaluated that the concepts of
                                    exploration and exploitation need to be discussed under different theoretical
                                    currents: technological innovation, organizational design, organizational
                                    adaptation, organizational learning, competitive advantage or organizational
                                    survival. (Oreilly III & Tushman, 2008) (Popadiuk, 2012) (Popadiuk et al., 2018).
                                    Since 2007 when the first article on ambidextrous was published in EnAnpad, other
                                    studies on the subject have been developed in Brazil among publications in
                                    periodicals, congresses, books, chapters, and dissertations. However, this
                                    discussion is still very incipient in Brazil. In the EnAnpad 2109 was presented only
                                    one Panel on the subject and three articles in 2020. However, since 2010, at least
                                    1,000 international articles on the subject have been published, according to the
                                    Web of Science. Thus, we understand that this discussion has the potential to be
                                    explored in the Brazilian context. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    For this, we suggest the submission of theoretical and empirical papers that
                                    contemplate the association of ambidexterity with social capital, entrepreneurship,
                                    absorptive capacity, knowledge transfer, knowledge sharing, organizational learning,
                                    networks, decision making, innovativeness, organizational structure, transaction
                                    cost, agency theory, sustainability.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Other associations are welcome, as long as they are genuinely and theoretically
                                    based on the perspective of ambidexterity.

                                    Semi-autonomous organizations are characterized by units with relative autonomy,
                                    usually present in highly hierarchical organizations or other types of relationship
                                    networks. This type of organization usually has its decision-making and
                                    administrative structure and enjoys some autonomy (Meyer et al., 2017). However,
                                    they remain linked to central administration and a code of standards to be followed.
                                    In these cases, parent organizations' performance, whether public or private,
                                    depends more firmly on semi-autonomous units' performance (Barnabas & Mekoth, 2010;
                                    Gelade & Young, 2005; Sengul & Gimeno, 2013). It is the case for corporate branches
                                    (Menz, Kunisch, & Collis, 2015), franchises (Blut, Backhaus, Heussler,
                                    Woisetschläger, Evanschitzky, & Ahlert, 2011), amoeba management (Adler & Hiromoto,
                                    2012; Urban, 2017; Meyer et al., 2017), and other types of organizations from a
                                    growing movement of empowerment, flexibility, and agility, focusing on results that
                                    is happening in retail in general and in retail banks (Sierra et al., 2019).<br />
                                    On the other hand, temporary organizations are characterized by situations in which
                                    the structures are developed with a determined time. For example, in organizations'
                                    strategic projects, in field hospitals, or in a semi-permanent way, as in repetitive
                                    events. In strategic projects, they continue to impact companies even after the
                                    closure (Eskerod et al., 2015) or, still, management of semi-autonomous teams,
                                    called amoeba management (Urban, 2017).<br />
                                    Due to the influence of semi-autonomous and temporary organizations in the parent
                                    organizations' strategic performance, in this theme, it is proposed to organize this
                                    research dispersed, mainly, in the context of an emerging country like Brazil. Thus,
                                    we suggest some submissions that can contribute and deepen this discussion on
                                    strategies in semi-autonomous and/or temporary organizations: Upper-Echelon Theory;
                                    Stakeholders; RBT (Resource Based View; Capabilities; Knowledge Based View);
                                    Neo-Institutional Theory (social and economic); among other approaches in strategy
                                    that can be studied in semi-autonomous and/or provisional organizations.

                                    The proposed theme is Enterprise Risk Management: Strategic Management,
                                    Organizational Performance, and Corporate Governance. Based on COSO (2004, 2017),
                                    considering risk as the possibility of an event to occur and negatively affecting
                                    the achievement of organizational objectives and opportunity as the possibility of
                                    an event to occur and favorably influence the achievement of organizational
                                    objectives, it is understood that The proposed theme is associated with the academic
                                    division “Strategy in Organizations”, in the sense that enterprise risk management
                                    conspires for the effective implementation of organizations' strategy. The approach
                                    adopted addresses risks from all possible sources that impact organizational
                                    management, for example, financial risks, strategic risks, operational risks,
                                    political risks, economic risks, natural risks, image risks, cyber risks, and
                                    others. In an integrated way, it can be understood that enterprise risk management
                                    connects with strategic planning through the assessment of organizational
                                    performance measured by the Balanced Scorecard (Kaplan, 2012, 2009). Thus, the
                                    timeliness and importance of the proposed theme “Enterprise Risk Management and
                                    Organizational Performance” lies in its proximity as a management tool to enhance
                                    the achievement of the objectives proposed by the organizational strategy in an
                                    increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous environment. Going far
                                    beyond compliance, compliance with rules, which may at first glance prove to be a
                                    reactive approach, enterprise risk management proactively aims to identify, analyze
                                    and address business risks by seeking to increase the possibility of that
                                    organizational objectives are realized, increasing the performance of organizations.
                                    Additionally, it is noteworthy that enterprise risk management must go beyond the
                                    boundaries of the organization, considering that the risks increase as the
                                    organization establishes relationships with other agents of the business
                                    environment. In this sense, in an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and
                                    ambiguous business environment, corporate risk management is an essential
                                    administrative tool to support the principles of good corporate governance that
                                    inspire greater confidence in the relationships established with the agents involved
                                    ( OECD, 2015).<br />

                                    Departing from the concept of strategizing, doing strategy has gained new contours
                                    and
                                    it is being understood as a socially immersed practice (Vaara & Whittington, 2012).
                                    This
                                    recognition opened space for an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon, as well as
                                    dialogues and intersections for an understanding of strategy with different
                                    perspectives
                                    of the field of management, organizations, social theory and language studies
                                    (Golsorkhi, Rouleau, Seidl & Vaara, 2015). From the contribution of Whittington
                                    (1996),
                                    who took a comprehensive look at strategy, by understanding strategy as a social
                                    practice (from the practice turn of social science) to explain that strategy is a
                                    localized realization, built daily by a series of practitioners (Jarzabkowski,
                                    Kaplan,
                                    Seidl, & Whittington, 2016). It is understood that the strategy is realized at a
                                    micro
                                    level, but also carries all meanings, models, tools, values, etc., which are shared
                                    at
                                    the macro-level (Golsorkhi, Seidl, Rouleau, & Vaara, 2015). <br />
                                    In face of this discussion, the phenomenon of strategy in this theme can be
                                    understood
                                    from: (i) diverse onto-epistemological approaches, (ii) different theories,
                                    conceptions,
                                    sociological and organizational concepts, and (iii) innovative methodological
                                    procedures
                                    and non-traditional approaches. <br />
                                    Thus, we call papers especially interested in themes, conceptions and approaches
                                    regarding: <br />
                                    (i) practices developed by different practitioners and professionals, for example,
                                    middle managers as articulators of strategizing;<br />
                                    (ii) the role of routines in the articulation of processes and practices of
                                    strategizing;<br />
                                    (iii) the socio-material dimension and the participation of non-human elements in
                                    strategizing;<br />
                                    (iv) the language elements involved (discourses, narratives, rhetoric,
                                    vocabularies);<br />
                                    (v) the open strategizing practices and initiatives considering the openness and
                                    closure
                                    paradox<br />
                                    (vi) the processsuality and the temporality of the phenomenon from the strong
                                    process
                                    view;<br />
                                    (vii) the role of history and memory in the strategizing;<br />
                                    (viii) strategizing in hybrid, extreme, pluralistic, and/or digital institutional
                                    contexts;<br />
                                    (ix) other theoretical approaches and interactions to illuminate the strategy
                                    making.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    We encourage studies thinking about research problems that can (re)discuss the logic
                                    and
                                    dominant assumptions of the field of strategy from idiosyncratic angles of Brazilian
                                    reality. Thus, we propose some provocative (but not exhaustive) questions about the
                                    theme: <br />
                                    - How do managers, with their own models in the field of strategy, appropriate,
                                    interpret, build and rebuild them for the realization of the strategy? <br />
                                    - How do different actors (intra and inter-organizational) get involved in this
                                    perspective? <br />
                                    - How does language become a central element in strategy making? <br />
                                    - How are artifacts and socio-material elements used in this daily realization?
                                    <br />
                                    - How do practices and processes vary concerning the nature of the organization?
                                    <br />
                                    - How does strategic doing take place in pluralistic contexts and/or in
                                    non-traditional
                                    organizational processes? <br />
                                    - How is time, history, memory intertwined with the strategy-making? <br />
                                    - How do different organizational practices affect the opening of the strategy?
                                    <br />
                                    - What methodological procedures allow concatenating the different dimensions and/or
                                    elements of strategy making? <br />
                                    <br />
                                    New questions are welcome, as long as they are under a genuine and theoretically

                                    This theme discusses the tricks of the trade of doing research and of implementing
                                    non-market strategy nowadays local and international. The world has suffered
                                    considerable political turmoil in recent years that has urged firms to deploy
                                    adaptive
                                    and proactive strategies in the non-market environment. For example, in Latin
                                    America,
                                    is common for the firms nurturing political connections with the home government
                                    (BANDEIRA-DE-MELLO; ARREOLA; MARCON, 2012), there is a relationship history between
                                    firms and government (GAMA; BANDEIRA-DE-MELLO; SPULDARO, 2018; MUSACCHIO; LAZZARINI,
                                    2016). In addition, companies are increasingly adapting their socio-environmental
                                    strategies, via a partnership with non-profit associations or even directly
                                    (Gatignon
                                    and Capron, 2020). There is some research that appears to indicate an import of
                                    strategy
                                    beyond the market after COVID-19, as a way to generate competitive advantage
                                    (Lawton,
                                    Dorobantu, Rawjani and Sun, 2020).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Given this context, this theme will aim at addressing these questions: <br />
                                    - What role has the theory played in explaining the strategic relationship between
                                    business and government? <br />
                                    - What role should it play going forward to explain this phenomenon in Latin America
                                    and
                                    in develop countries? <br />
                                    - To what extent does rampant corruption is an opportunity and a threat to research
                                    and
                                    practice of the business and government relationship? <br />
                                    - What are the research opportunities available in Latin America considering the
                                    availability of the data? <br />
                                    - What will be the best non-market strategies to address future political issues
                                    that
                                    affect strategizing and organizing domestic and foreign firms? <br />
                                    - What is the future of corporate social responsibility (CSR)?<br />
                                    - How the MNEs are adapting their non-market strategies after the institutional
                                    shocks?
                                    <br />
                                    - How a firm's social and political arenas might be a competitive advantage local
                                    and
                                    global? <br />
                                    - How nonmarket strategies affect the firm's internationalization? the relationship
                                    between home and host country? <br />
                                    - How nonmarket strategies become competitive advantages beyond the home country
                                    boundaries? <br />

                                    This line of research aims to group studies of the different interorganizational and
                                    interpersonal relationships established in different types of business networks,
                                    their
                                    dyadic and multiple connections, vertical and horizontal, in relations of
                                    cooperation,
                                    competition and coopetition, as well as their relationship with performance based on
                                    creation and capture of value. It has, as base theories, the view based on
                                    resources,
                                    networks, theory of transaction costs and its variants. It also includes the process
                                    of
                                    creating, transferring and applying knowledge in different types of relationships

                                    Information and Communication Technologies . It also considers social relationships
                                    between individuals, formal and informal, and their impact on organizations. It also
                                    seeks to study how tacit phenomena impact the performance of organizations,
                                    considering
                                    social capital and trust as integrating elements of different social actors, as well
                                    as
                                    the dynamics established in these relationships based on the different elements of

                                    Family business is the most common type of business around the world. In most
                                    countries,
                                    family business are the main responsible for employment and wealth generation
                                    (Zellweger, 2017). Even among public companies, families are the large shareholders
                                    (Bennedsen, Pérez-González, & Wolfenzon, 2010). This predominance has led to a
                                    growing
                                    number of studies focused on these companies. However, the simple prevalence of
                                    family
                                    business is not enough to consider it a topic of study, it is necessary to observe
                                    what
                                    makes the family firms a different body of organizations. Thus, the studies in this
                                    field has been driven by the perspective that family involvement in business through

                                    strategy
                                    (Chrisman, Chua, & Sharma, 2005; Chua, Chrisman, & Sharma, 1999). Family members may
                                    seek to satisfy their non-economic objectives through the company, which involves
                                    emotional aspects. Therefore, family members, even if not present in the company's
                                    daily
                                    life, can influence the strategic decisions. On the other hand, family cohesion can
                                    be a
                                    source of advantage, which represents trust to customers, employees, investors, and
                                    other stakeholders. In a positive or negative way, the constant interaction between
                                    family and business systems is a unique characteristic of family businesses. Under
                                    this
                                    view, family businesses behave differently from their counterparts, since non-family
                                    businesses do not have family as a stakeholder.<br />
                                    From this perspective, this track expects to receive papers, with different
                                    theoretical
                                    and methodological lenses, which contribute to the knowledge advancement about
                                    family
                                    businesses, considering the peculiarities of families and how their relations with
                                    the

                                    Studies
                                    that address family strategies as a business family will also be welcome.
                                    Noteworthy,
                                    the track is not restricted to the comparison of family businesses with their
                                    counterparts, so we are also looking for studies that explore the heterogeneity
                                    between
                                    family businesses.<br />

                                    Capabilities are different constructs integrated into companies to generate
                                    competitive
                                    advantage. Teece et al. (1997) argue that the term refers to the fundamental role of
                                    strategic management in adapting, integrating, and reconfiguring internal and
                                    external
                                    organizational processes and routines, resources, and functional skills to meet the
                                    needs of a changing environment. For the execution and development of a capacity,
                                    integration processes, and a combination of resources are necessary for
                                    effectiveness
                                    will be achieved through routines (Eisenhart & Martin, 2000; Zollo & Winter, 2002).
                                    The
                                    traditional conception of routines applies to relatively stable or predictably
                                    changing
                                    environments, the process of which depends on existing knowledge (Wang & Ahmed,
                                    2007).
                                    On the other hand, for dynamic environments, a different type of capacity is
                                    necessary
                                    to respond to this environment, called dynamic capabilities, and are based on the
                                    generation of new knowledge (Ray, Barney & Muhanna, 2004). Capabilities, as well as
                                    resources, have been the subject of numerous classifications, suggesting that they
                                    can
                                    range from basic and common to advanced, scarce, and strategically important
                                    (Schriber &
                                    Löwstedt, 2015). The literature distinguishes a considerable variety of capabilities
                                    that operate in stable and dynamic environments (Eisenhart & Martin, 2000).The
                                    research
                                    identified and categorized capabilities at three levels (Carattoli, 2013), zero or
                                    ordinary (allowing the company to earn a living), first-level or dynamic
                                    capabilities,
                                    related to a company's ability to adapt, create, develop and modify the resource
                                    base in
                                    response to environmental changes (Giniuniene & Jurksiene, 2015) and the
                                    higher-order
                                    resources that result in the modification of the previous level.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Within this context, we propose studies on the capacities (dynamic capacity;
                                    absorptive
                                    capacity; innovative capacity; adaptive capacity, digital capacities, among others)
                                    to
                                    be submitted. In this sense, this track instigates the submission of articles that
                                    advance in the studies of capabilities and resources, including new empirical
                                    approaches. In addition to the articles now developed, we also suggest those that
                                    take
                                    into account the scope, considering that several factors can assist in capacity
                                    building, leading to equal or superior performances. Articles with multilevel models
                                    that can handle capacities at various levels are also welcome. We need to go beyond
                                    a
                                    focus of definition to a configurational target. It implies not only a comparison of
                                    the
                                    different levels and types of capacities but also mixtures of it conditioned to the
                                    structure of the company. Let us think about how to account for heterogeneity, and
                                    this
                                    implies that capacity development does not present an overall optimal model with
                                    variations for contingencies, but different optimal models for diverse firms and
                                    sectors. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    The proposal for this track is not limited to looking exclusively at studies on
                                    capabilities. It will also accept articles which may contribute to the relation of
                                    capabilities with other theoretical fields: (1) RBV; (2) technology and innovation
                                    management; (3) international business; (4) digital transformation; (5) operations

                                    of organizations, in the search for innovation and the inclusion of ethical, social
                                    and
                                    environmental values in addition to economic commitment. For that purpose, the
                                    proposed
                                    theme is subdivided into three major axes, detailed below.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    1. Organizational Strategies for Sustainability<br />
                                    <br />
                                    This axis addresses the theories, concepts and practices related to the processes of
                                    conception, implementation and evaluation of strategies for sustainability in
                                    public,
                                    private or third sector organizations, proposing to discuss the strategic challenges
                                    for
                                    the transition of organizations towards sustainability. The topics covered are
                                    competitive and collaborative strategies to achieve the socio-environmental
                                    sustainability of organizations; sustainable strategic projects; creating
                                    sustainable
                                    value for multiple organizations' stakeholders; sustainability functional
                                    strategies;
                                    strategic management of sustainability in the value chain; strategies for the
                                    implantation of industrial ecoparks and circular economy. It also seeks to stimulate
                                    discussion of the motivating and limiting factors of business adaptation, changes in
                                    routines and the development of dynamic social and environmental capacities.
                                    Moreover,
                                    research is encouraged on models for measuring sustainability and
                                    socio-environmental
                                    performance; sustainable balanced scorecard; Triple Bottom Line, and indicators
                                    related
                                    to the Sustainable Development Objectives (SDG).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    2. Innovative and Sustainable Business Models<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In this axis, the concepts and practices related to the new business models that
                                    seek to
                                    achieve sustainability through different paths are discussed, causing, above all,
                                    the
                                    positive impacts of a social and environmental nature. The axis covers topics such
                                    as:
                                    strategies related to sustainable social and environmental entrepreneurship;
                                    strategic
                                    social and environmental projects; B corporations; business of social and / or
                                    environmental impact; business oriented to the base of the pyramid; business models
                                    based on shared economy and circular economy; financing strategies for social and
                                    environmental projects and businesses; institutional partnerships for business and
                                    social-environmental projects. The main concern is to discuss the creation of
                                    strategically oriented businesses for sustainability through the application of
                                    innovative business models that allow the systematic management of social and
                                    environmental practices.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    3.Strategies and Climate Change<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Climate change and the impacts of extreme weather events pose a major threat to
                                    business
                                    operations and the development of a long-term strategy. On the one hand, companies
                                    are
                                    increasingly facing pressure to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to
                                    mitigate
                                    the effects of climate change. On the other hand, business operations, assets and
                                    supply
                                    chains are threatened by the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events. The
                                    relevance of climate change adaptation studies lies not only in the identification
                                    of
                                    the motivating and limiting factors but also in the recognition that changes in
                                    routines
                                    and capacity development need an adequate context to be perceived and assimilated.
                                    Thus,
                                    this axis seeks to stimulate discussions that analyze how companies incorporate
                                    climate
                                    change into their strategic planning and promote the adaptation of their resources.

                                    The relationship between entrepreneurship and strategy is an interesting
                                    intersection for the discipline of strategic management. By strategy, we mean a
                                    series of interdependent activities through which companies create a competitive
                                    advantage. By entrepreneurship, we mean nascent companies competing for nascent
                                    markets, with the latter characterized as abstract, since they are not established.
                                    That said, we can argue that the entrepreneurial strategy is the strategy-making
                                    process in contexts of uncertainty, ambiguity, and fast pace (Ott & Eisenhardt,
                                    2020). In addition, entrepreneurial behavior can also be observed in established
                                    companies when there is a need to expand into new markets or innovate (Davidsson,
                                    2016). Therefore, it seems interesting to understand how entrepreneurs and
                                    established companies formulate strategies to create and capture value under
                                    conditions of uncertainty and the variables involved in this process. Important
                                    research lines that combine contextual backgrounds and individual attributes
                                    (experience, uncertainty, and resourcefulness) as influencers of the strategic
                                    process can advance the understanding of the emerging strategy. Examples of these
                                    approaches would be Effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2008) and Bricolage (Baker & Nelson,
                                    2005), considered as flexible approaches and oriented to learning by doing (focus on
                                    the action). Other research lines focus on the entrepreneur's cognitive ability as
                                    an essential element for strategy-making, that is, combining a sequence of
                                    activities that lead the enterprise to sustainable competitive advantage. Examples
                                    of these approaches are found in the literature on managerial cognition and dynamic
                                    capabilities, for example (Helfat & Peteraf, 2015). In this way, there is an
                                    opportunity to explore the benefits of a possible balance between these two research
                                    lines (strategic management and entrepreneurship) and understand how entrepreneurs
                                    can combine the flexibility derived from action oriented to learning and a
                                    structured process of strategic formulation (Ott et al., 2017). Additionally, we see
                                    the opportunity to combine these approaches on entrepreneurship and some established
                                    theories on strategy (namely the Resource-Based Theory and its aspects, Transaction
                                    Cost Theory, Stakeholder Theory, among others). Based on the above, we consider some
                                    themes for this line:<br />
                                    • Differences in the strategic formulation process when we consider business as
                                    usual versus an orientation towards innovation or growth;<br />
                                    • Consolidated theories in strategic management that can provide insights into the
                                    approaches used in the literature on entrepreneurship;<br />
                                    • Effectuation, causation and/or bricolage and the influence of their respective
                                    antecedents (contextual and individual) on entrepreneurial action;<br />
                                    • Approaches as trial and error, experimentation and learning and their possible
                                    impacts on the performance of the new venture;<br />
                                    • Influence of the cognitive processes and mental models during strategic
                                    formulation;<br />
                                    • External factors (social, economic and political crises, negative market
                                    feedbacks) and their impact on entrepreneurial thinking and action (e.g., pivoting,
                                    reformulation of the business model, improvisation with resources, resource
                                    orchestration, turnaround);<br />
                                    • Methodologies that can capture the entrepreneurial process in nascent or already
                                    established companies.

                                    The strategic management of organizations involves a wide range of stakeholders,
                                    defined as groups or individuals that affect or are affected by the organization in
                                    the pursuit of its objectives (Freeman, 1984). Understanding the relationships of
                                    these actors and their influence on organizational performance and value creation
                                    has gained prominence in the management literature (Boaventura, Bosse, Mascena and
                                    Sarturi, 2020; Barney, 2018; Harrison, Bosse and Phillips, 2010; Tantalo and Priem,
                                    2016). In order to contemplate theoretical and empirical advances on these issues,
                                    the theme is divided into three themes. The Stakeholder management theme advances in
                                    the discussion on stakeholder management in different organizations and contexts and
                                    its interface with other themes in the management literature. The theme on Value
                                    aims to discuss and advance about the concept of value and its consequences on
                                    organizational context. Finally, the Organizational performance theme includes the
                                    analysis of the performance antecedents, performance measurement and the
                                    relationship between organizational strategy and performance.<br />

                                    Although the understanding of business networks, clusters, and ecosystems and their
                                    respective contributions to socio-economic performance has expanded steadily in
                                    recent decades, the literature houses an essential diversity of theoretical
                                    assumptions and empirical observations that are not distinct and often paradoxical.
                                    There is a lack of integration and dialogue between studies and approaches in the
                                    literature. This fact reflects the difficulty in understanding the complex
                                    interrelationships within, between, and beyond these arrangements and forms of
                                    governance.<br />

                                    Scientific research in strategy has been developed with a dual approach, theoretical
                                    advancement and benefits or implications for practitioners. There is still no
                                    complete clarity on how to address this dual approach, in part because there are not
                                    yet as many technological articles (Biancolino et al., 2012). Technological articles
                                    are scientific articles in terms of methodological rigor and theoretical foundation
                                    (Motta, 2017), which lead to discussions about the application of certain knowledge
                                    in strategy, notably adhering to the interests of practitioners (Rojo & Walter,
                                    2014). The potential for disseminating knowledge about the strategy of a
                                    technological article is one of the interests of this theme proposed here, involving
                                    the development of new products (Wang et al., 2020; Zhan et al., 2020), range of
                                    competences, relationship between university and industry (Cheng et al., 2020; Kohus
                                    et al., 2020), strategic indicators (Lai & Yuen, 2020; Villarreal et al., 2020;)
                                    among many other possibilities that lie outside the theoretical field, but which are
                                    relevant to the management and strategy of organizations. For that, discussions
                                    about the form and content of technological articles are interesting, adaptation or
                                    development of methods adhering to technological articles, definition of descriptive
                                    sections on the applicability of knowledge and the way results are discussed,
                                    oriented to provide insights, comparisons with similar strategic scenarios in
                                    addition to offering actionable and applicable artifacts in different contexts than
                                    the original research (Rosini et al., 2015). Therefore, it is a matter of discussing
                                    possibilities for the production of international quality applied research in the
                                    strategy area, documented in the form of a technological article, rigorously
                                    constructed, from a methodological and theoretical point of view, with a high

                                    In 2007, Nag, Hambrick and Chen, in the manuscript entitled “What is strategic
                                    management, really? Inductive derivation of a field consensus definition”, published
                                    in the Strategic Management Journal, discuss the definition of strategy and its
                                    field, incorporating six elements: “The field of strategic management deals with the
                                    main intended and emerging initiatives taken by general managers on behalf of
                                    owners, involving the use of resources, to improve the performance of companies in
                                    their external environments ”(Nag, Hambrick & Chen, 2007, p. 944). Notably, since
                                    the seminal propositions of Chandler (1962) about the concept of strategy, the field
                                    has evolved and sought to answer questions that go beyond these elements (Burgelman
                                    et al., 2018). In addition, Nag, Hambrick & Chen, (2007 p. 952) argue that strategy
                                    as a field of study has “amorphous borders and inherent pluralism”, not restricted
                                    to theoretical approaches or dominant methodologies. This perspective is
                                    corroborated by Ronda-Pupo and Guerra Martins (2012).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    ANPAD, over the recent years, has encouraged the submission of themes that reflect
                                    research groups conduct according to their affinity around the themes proposed in
                                    the field of Strategic Management. We note, however, that there are emerging themes
                                    in which they may not be considered or contemplated only in a marginal manner, in
                                    addition to specific methodological challenges, of notable interest to the
                                    community. In addition, in line with recent themes proposed by the Strategic
                                    Management Society, we therefore seek to deepen traditional topics in the area of
                                    ??strategy that have evolved, especially in terms of their content and context,
                                    which can be observed by emerging methodological approaches and provide
                                    theoretical-conceptual discussions that advance.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Regarding the content of the strategy, we emphasize typical issues of the strategy
                                    levels, including generic, international, functional and corporate, including
                                    mergers and acquisitions, diversification, tacit collusion and alliances, among
                                    others, at home and abroad, are underlined, in addition to the highlight for the
                                    role of leadership and diversity. On the subject of the context of the strategy, the
                                    influence of the external environment contemplated in this theme is strongly
                                    highlighted, observed from the perspective of 03 (three) main approaches (see:
                                    Forsgren, 2013): (i) contingency theory and the necessary fit between strategy,
                                    organizational structure and external environment as a driver of performance; (ii)
                                    institutional theory and variables concerning political, economic, social and
                                    sectoral dimensions; and (iii) the behavioral theory of the relationship networks
                                    between the actors.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In summary, this theme seeks to include emerging or evolutionary themes,
                                    methodologies and approaches that are not being currently considered by the other
                                    ones. Examples could be: regional, local and sector studies of competitiveness,
                                    experiments and quasi-experiments in strategy, longitudinal and panel studies, in
                                    addition to typically qualitative, non-traditional approaches in the area, such as
                                    ethnography and phenomenology, which consider the content in a broader way and the
                                    context of the strategy and propose innovative discussions and reflections in the
                                    field.

                                    The Corporate Finance theme has as main objective to promote works on the main
                                    scientific, theoretical and practical aspects of financial administration,
                                    addressing the themes of financing decisions, investment decisions, mergers and
                                    acquisitions, dividend policy, working capital management, asymmetry information
                                    between managers and investors, etc.<br />
                                    Financing decisions result in the capital structure of companies, which have been
                                    studied since the seminal works of Modigliani and Miller (1958). Since then, several
                                    important studies have been and continue to be carried out on the subject, resulting
                                    in theories such as the trade-off theory and the pecking order theory. However,
                                    despite being widely researched, the topic is still inconclusive.<br />
                                    Investment decisions make up capital budget projects. It is mainly related to the
                                    analysis of expenditure on fixed and, eventually, intangible assets.<br />
                                    Working capital management forms working capital decisions, composed of current
                                    assets and liabilities (cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories,
                                    suppliers, etc.). Such decisions determine the short-term survival of organizations,
                                    whose determinants of liquidity, turnover and profitability basically base the
                                    analyzes carried out.<br />
                                    The dividend policy determines the distribution of profits to shareholders, in
                                    proportion to the proportions each has.<br />
                                    The waves of mergers and acquisitions represent the union of two or more companies
                                    according to the interests of the parties.<br />
                                    All these themes form the main scope of corporate finance, a fundamental pillar for
                                    the management of organizations.

                                    This topic investigates the relationship between Corporate Governance Mechanisms and
                                    the mitigation of corporate agency conflicts. Corporate Governance Mechanisms
                                    include the board of directors, ownership structure, ownership concentration, the
                                    presence of institutional investors, the presence of minority block-holders,
                                    executive compensation systems, internal control systems, among others. We also
                                    invite studies that investigate the institutional environment and the mechanisms or
                                    laws that protect the rights of investors (shareholders and creditors). We also
                                    invite studies about the empirical outcomes of adhering to the ESG (Environmental,
                                    Social, and Governance) practices. Furthermore, we invite submissions of studies
                                    that discuss the effects of creating, planning or incorporating corporate governance
                                    systems and policies on the financial and non-financial performance of
                                    organizations.

                                    This theme includes studies that deal with studies that consider behavioral biases
                                    and disorders, which contradict the full rationality of investors and managers. In
                                    addition, this topic covers studies of an experimental nature, which are becoming
                                    increasingly common in the area of ??finance. As has been discussed in the
                                    literature, there is a discussion about the efficiency of the markets. This
                                    discussion also gained weight due to the appearance of speculative bubbles, as was
                                    the case of the internet bubble that hit the United States stock market at the end
                                    of the 1990s. More recently, we had the subprime crisis that also raised any doubts
                                    as to market efficiency and asymmetric information problems that could be identified
                                    in the most developed market in the world, which is the North American market.
                                    Below, we present in more detail the topics that make up this theme. Studies on the
                                    behavior of agents, decision making, Prospect Theory, heuristics and cognitive bias,
                                    mental accounting, among other approaches. Disposition effect. Analysis of the

                                    The topic of investments and asset pricing is part of the Finance division. The
                                    following topics are included: evaluation of investment projects, evaluations using
                                    the real options approach; Investments in individual assets and portfolios, asset
                                    pricing models, both fixed income and equities, fund performance appraisal and
                                    company valuation. It is possible to develop, evaluate, test and propose Financial
                                    asset pricing methodologies for Investment Funds and Market Index Investment Funds,
                                    and for Credit Rights Investment Funds and Real Estate Investment Funds, only bonds
                                    and securities securities included in their investment portfolios. The methodologies
                                    are developed according to the characteristics of each asset or group of assets. The
                                    process and methodology must follow the best market practices. Information on prices
                                    or factors to be used in the pricing of financial assets should preferably be
                                    obtained from public sources to facilitate replication. Furthermore, as examples of
                                    empirical work, models based on consumption and overview can be used; contingent
                                    asset markets; mean-variance frontier and beta representations; relationships
                                    between discount factors, betas and average-variance boundaries; existence
                                    implications and equivalence theorems; conditioning information; etc. Also, studies
                                    linked to securities ownership (CDB), which is linked to bank debt; Federal
                                    Government Bonds, which is a government debt; and also the Debentures, which are
                                    debts of the companies.<br />

                                    The theme aims to stimulate high level research on Markets and Financial
                                    Institutions in
                                    Brazil and the World. Objectively, the proposed theme hosts discussion on the
                                    aspects of
                                    market integration, monetary policy and financial stability, volatility and
                                    contagion
                                    transmission channels, market regulation, corporate banking, ratings, corporate
                                    governance of financial institutions, market concentration, valuation and
                                    performance of
                                    financial institutions, among others. Stricto sensu, the theme is articulated under
                                    two
                                    objectives. The first (1) is substantive: contributing to the debate on financial
                                    stability, market regulation and integration, and the management and evaluation of
                                    financial institutions, enabling insights into and out of economic orthodoxy to
                                    produce
                                    a purposeful agenda in the light of the trinomial. “Corporate Banking x Regulation x
                                    Market Integration”. The second (2) is methodological, and is directly related to
                                    the
                                    objective of the theme: to consolidate methodologies of studies that allow the
                                    extrapolation of "enlightened skepticism" from simple empirical evidence.<br />
                                    In relation to objective (1), investigations are encouraged that bring relevant
                                    contributions from the point of view of the development of instruments and financial
                                    institutions participating in the domestic and international financial system. In
                                    this
                                    context, regulation, market integration and financial globalization underpin a
                                    fertile
                                    research environment beyond classic institutional guidelines. Alternative monetary
                                    policies, reform, and new regulatory instruments provide a context for the
                                    production of
                                    comparative institutional reconstructions, discussing the evolution of certain
                                    governance arrangements of the financial system. That said, the proposed theme aims
                                    to
                                    provide an appropriate environment for the production and delivery of high impact
                                    investigations on the Markets and Financial Institutions.<br />

                                    Corporate and market risk management encompasses the study of value generation
                                    through
                                    the understanding of credit granting and risk analysis processes, the ability to use
                                    financial instruments for organizational leverage, and more specifically the use of
                                    financial derivatives. as an instrument for maximizing value. The aim is to favor
                                    decision-making processes under the theme of risks in view of the use of macro and
                                    micro
                                    economic information, the use of derivatives to protect market fluctuations in the
                                    assets that make up investment portfolios. It involves identifying, assessing,
                                    prioritizing risks in a coordinated manner, with practical applications to minimize
                                    the
                                    impact of unexpected and negative events or even to maximize the expected results

                                    the organization. Topics on this topic include, but are not limited to, risk
                                    identification and analysis; assessment of risks arising from the use of financial
                                    instruments, with an emphasis on the use of derivatives; minimizing threats and

                                    Data science has been driven by technological innovations and the massive generation
                                    and
                                    storage of information. Comprehensively, data science incorporates the use of
                                    scientific
                                    methods that explore statistical and computational tools, which are also

                                    assessing
                                    and preventing human errors or failures in systems, analyzing propensity to purchase
                                    financial services or products, etc. The results of academic research have suggested
                                    that machine learning models outperform traditional statistical techniques. <br />
                                    The top finance journals are also exploring data science, bringing not only
                                    theoretical
                                    discussions supported by empirical analyzes through traditional regressions but also
                                    analyzes using techniques that explore big data and machine learning. From the
                                    perspective of finance theory, the use of more recent data science techniques can
                                    contribute to the investigation of hypotheses based on an empirical analysis less
                                    restricted by the usual regression models. <br />
                                    in this theme of the Finance Division, we privilege studies that explore data
                                    science to
                                    advance knowledge about theory and practice in finance. More specifically, we seek
                                    studies that analyze how and why models and techniques of artificial intelligence,
                                    machine learning and big data contribute to a better understanding of financial
                                    phenomena, bringing discussions about empirical evidence and theoretical paradigms.

                                    which are not covered in the other thematic areas, as they are emerging issues.

                                    Sustainable finance generally refers to the process of taking environmental, social
                                    and
                                    governance (ESG) considerations into account when making investment decisions,
                                    leading
                                    to greater long-term investments in sustainable economic activities and projects.
                                    Environmental considerations can refer to mitigation and adaptation to climate
                                    change,
                                    as well as to the environment more broadly, such as the preservation of

                                    prevention of pollution and circular economy. <br />

                                    following are proposed: <br />

                                    and
                                    governance), SDG (sustainable development objective - ONU) and measurement metrics,
                                    blended finance, circular economy, carbon credit.<br />
                                    (b) FinTechs<br />
                                    (c) Cryptocurrencies: Crowdfunding, blockchain, cryptocurrency, ICO (initial coin

                                    The value of companies has been increasingly influenced by their ability to generate
                                    innovations in products and services, as well as creating effective mechanisms to
                                    appropriate the value of such innovations (Ceccagnoli, 2009; Laursen & Salter,
                                    2014). Thus, the protection of intellectual property (IP) assets has become
                                    paramount in the current knowledge society (Lall, 2003; Castells, 2000), being the
                                    main formal mechanism for appropriating innovations (Hall et al., 2014; Hurmelinna
                                    -Laukkanen & Puumalainen, 2007). As such, companies operating in highly competitive
                                    and knowledge-intensive sectors need to build robust IP asset portfolios, such as
                                    trademarks, patents, industrial designs and copyrights, to promote competitiveness
                                    (Huang & Cheng, 2015; Drivas et al., 2016). In addition, Brazilian universities have
                                    demonstrated an increasing engagement with IP assets, being, for example, in recent
                                    years, organizations installed in the country with the largest number of patent
                                    application filings. In view of the growing importance of intangibles, and a more
                                    fragile context of guaranteeing intellectual property in emerging countries like
                                    Brazil (Cuervo-Cazurra & Rui, 2017), the study of this theme is relevant to the
                                    national context. The theme involves research related to the management of
                                    intellectual property and technology transfer, including: technological prospection
                                    in the field of intellectual property; monitoring trends in trademark registrations;
                                    intellectual property challenges in digital transformation; assessment of the
                                    impacts of geographical indications (GIs); proposition and evaluation of strategies
                                    for transferring innovations generated by Science and Technology Institutions
                                    (STIs); evaluation of public policies to encourage the protection of creations;
                                    management of technology transfer agreements from STIs; assessment of the
                                    relationship of STIs with companies; evaluation of public policies to encourage the
                                    protection of creations; evaluation of the convenience of protecting creations and
                                    their dissemination; evaluation of the performance of Technology Transfer Offices
                                    (TTOs) and technological tools to support the management of intellectual property
                                    and technology transfer. In addition, this theme also focuses on analyzing the
                                    impact of intellectual property on environments that promote innovation in the
                                    academic, business, governmental and social organizations.

                                    Renewal and change are at the heart of innovation; new themes and technologies often
                                    emerge, becoming challenges for the management of organizations, which must be
                                    prepared to analyze and manage emerging trends. Thus, this track covers studies that
                                    include emerging trends in innovation, which have not yet been widely discussed in
                                    any other track and which express potential debate and interest of the Innovation,
                                    Technology and Entrepreneurship Division. Examples of topics and questions of
                                    interest may be, although not limited to:<br />
                                    <br />
                                    - Although advantage in global innovation is recognized, there is evidence that the
                                    ‘regional strategy’ agenda has recently emerged (Verbeke and Asmussen, 2016), and
                                    different aspects of proximity (as described by Boschma, 2005) should be considered
                                    for better understanding of geographical distance impacts on partnerships for
                                    innovation in both interorganizations and intra-organizations (offshoring). How can
                                    organizations benefit from the dispersed and geographically distant knowledge? How
                                    to overcome the challenge of long-distance collaboration? How do substitution and/or
                                    overlap (Hansen, 2015) influence the relations between partners with differences
                                    both geographical and non-spatial?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    - Internationalization of R&D has been studied since the 1990’s, however there are
                                    still gaps to be focused: Deepen understanding of differences between companies from
                                    developed and developing countries both as home and host of R&D offshoring (Zedtwitz
                                    et al., 2015); Which are the R&D changes of the country of origin over time
                                    (Belderbos, et al., 2013)? Is local / regional development related to the
                                    participation of (foreign or national) MNCs in National Innovation System
                                    (Papanastassiou,et al. 2020)?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    - Transformative Innovation is considered for addressing global challenges such as
                                    sustainability and inclusiveness. This requires the involvement of multiple actors
                                    and stakeholders, thus a research agenda is needed for management of distinct
                                    concerns and policy making (Schot and Steinmueller, 2018), arising questions: What
                                    are the trends in Policies for transformative innovation? Which are the needed
                                    abilities to involve different actors in the self-governance of transformative
                                    innovation? How entrepreneurs profile, motivations and opportunities can guide
                                    transformative Innovation?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    - Adoption and diffusion of technological trends in several organizations have
                                    behaved like catapults to promote transformation of industries and opportunities for
                                    new business (e.g. 3D printing, artificial intelligence, IoT, autonomous vehicles,
                                    blockchain, biotech, nanotech). These topics are usually discussed from technical
                                    point of view, however scholars have neglected peculiarities of innovation
                                    management. How organizations develop capabilities for dealing with technological
                                    trends? What aspects of entrepreneurial activities matter for their adoption and
                                    diffusion?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    - Although there are studies on the impacts of the process of financialization on
                                    investments in innovation (Lazonick and Mazzucato, 2013), the relationship between
                                    financialization and innovation management has been little explored. What conditions
                                    and contingencies does a financialized perspective of capitalism bring to the
                                    management, organization and results of innovation?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    4 ? How can the approach to innovation as a complex and performative practice and
                                    process (Garud et al., 2018; Langley et al, 2013) contribute to issues such as
                                    uncertainty handling, learning, dynamic capacity building, strategic definitions,
                                    and more? What categories / concepts are relevant to address performativity and
                                    complexity and innovation as a process?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    - Innovation and work. What concepts / categories are needed to understand the work
                                    of innovation? What elements of work organization are relevant to innovation? How to
                                    articulate this discussion with the question of ambidexterity, especially contextual
                                    ambidexterity (Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004)? How to articulate existing concepts
                                    (competences, autonomy, cooperation ...) to explain innovation as a complex process
                                    and support innovation management?<br />
                                    <br />
                                    - How new trends in entrepreneurship such as sustainable Business Models (Roome e
                                    Louche, 2016) imply the involvement of the stakeholders in the creation of capture
                                    of value? Innovative Business Models for Circular Economy (Lewandowski, 2016) in
                                    part as an opportunity of digializatization implies new ways to improve efficiency
                                    and reduce impacts on the environment comes as a new trend? Can this new Business

                                    - How can the circular economy provide opportunities for more sustainable impact
                                    businesses (Weetman, 2019)? In 2030, it is estimated that the world population will
                                    be 9 billion, which represents almost 3 billion more people consuming a whole
                                    variety of products and services. There is a consensus that maintaining such a high
                                    level of consumption today will be unsustainable due to the low amount of natural
                                    resources available (Bradshaw and Brook, 2014, WWF, 2012, Dauvergne, 2010). This
                                    depletion of the various natural resources, together with the problems related to
                                    the excess waste generated by the huge increase in consumption, will require new
                                    business paradigms.<br />

                                    - Can collaborative consumption change our world? Collaborative consumption allows
                                    people, in addition to realizing the enormous benefits of accessing products and
                                    services to the detriment of property, to save money, space and time. Through social
                                    networks, smart grids and real-time technologies, an overcoming of outdated
                                    hyper-consumption modes begins to happen, creating innovative systems, based on
                                    shared use, giving rise to new collaborative business models. (Cohen & Kietzmann,
                                    2014).<br />

                                    - Why is co-creation important in creating new businesses? The co-creation strategy
                                    implies the creation of value by a group of stakeholders to obtain mutual benefits.
                                    Therefore, it involves the involvement of different audiences (employees, suppliers,
                                    customers) and even other companies in the process of creating / producing
                                    something. The term's authorship is due to Prahalad and Ramaswamy (2004). However,
                                    other concepts such as open innovation (Chesbrough, 2006) and crowdsourcing (Howe,
                                    2009) are related to co-creation and all imply the creative participation of people
                                    and entities that, through creativity, resource sharing contribute to add value to
                                    new businesses.

                                    The pursuit of the objectives of Sustainable Development has been increasingly
                                    present in the discourses of academics, researchers, policymakers and even of
                                    industry representatives. Therefore, innovation is one of the most profitable areas
                                    to achieve sustainability in the different spheres of society (BOONS; LÜDEKE-FREUND,
                                    2013, BOSSLE et al., 2016, MATOS; SILVESTRE, 2013). Eco-innovation, or environmental
                                    innovation, consists of new or modified processes, techniques, systems and products
                                    that prevent or reduce environmental impacts (KEMP; ARUNDEL, 1998). KESIDOU;
                                    DEMIREL, 2012), caused by consumption and production activities (CARRILLO; GONZÁLEZ;
                                    KÖNNÖLÄ, 2009). Eco-innovation is not limited to innovation in products, processes,
                                    marketing methods and organizational methods, it can bring about sociocultural and
                                    institutional structures changes (OECD, 2009); besides used for pollution prevention
                                    and control (KEMP; PONTOGLIO, 2011). The drivers of eco-innovation adoption, such as
                                    regulation ( ), have led to the development of green products, sustainable
                                    management techniques and waste reduction (KEMP; PONTOGLIO, 2011). As well as clean
                                    energy sources (KEMP; PEARSON, 2008; KEMP; PONTOGLIO, 2011), creating new market
                                    spaces for products and services or processes oriented to environmental issues
                                    (CHARTER; CLARK, 2007; OLTRA; SAINT JEAN, 2009) integrating the Research and
                                    Development (R&D) area (CHARTER; CLARK, 2007). Thus, environmental innovation serves
                                    to prevent, reduce, diagnose and monitor anthropogenic damages generated by human
                                    actions (MARKUSSON, 2001) leading to the need to optimize the use of natural
                                    resources, such as energy and water, more efficiently. (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2007;
                                    KEMP; PONTOGLIO, 2011). In this context, industrial, environmental, technological
                                    and scientific policies must converge (COENEN; LÓPEZ, 2010) Hence, this call for
                                    papers aims to explore researches that relate different theoretical and
                                    methodological applications to the context of ecoinnovation. Some current and
                                    emerging topics of high interest for this call are: clean technologies;

                                    The emergence and expansion of social enterprises in different parts of the globe
                                    makes this phenomenon a focus of study of the administrative sciences, both to
                                    understand their empirical characteristics and to equip them with knowledge from the
                                    theory of organizations and the possibilities of modeling appropriate tools
                                    management. There is a trend of value review in traditional enterprises,
                                    particularly in terms of greater awareness of the impact they wish to have on
                                    society and the environment. As a result, new hybrid organizational formats emerge,
                                    seeking to achieve two goals previously seen as incompatible: financial
                                    sustainability and socio-environmental value generation. "Social enterprises",
                                    "inclusive businesses", "social businesses", and "businesses with social impact" are
                                    some of the terms currently used to explain organizations that seek to solve
                                    socio-environmental problems efficiently, and achieve financial sustainability
                                    through market mechanisms. Because it is a new terminology imported from the
                                    business environment, it has been the subject of vigorous debate between academics
                                    and practitioners. Nevertheless, there has been tension caused by the lack of a
                                    common understanding about this new concept which aims to reconcile two themes
                                    previously seen as irreconcilable: business and social impact. The lack of a
                                    homogeneous view is explained by two main factors: the different ways of defining
                                    the social character of the enterprises, and the different ways of evaluating the
                                    innovative character of this type of organization. ln this broad spectrum of actors,
                                    the configurations of these businesses take different forms. Each organization will
                                    position itself according to its objectives and interests, giving a different weight
                                    to each of the factors that make up the concept. ln 2019, a survey conducted by Pipe
                                    Social mapped 1002 businesses social enterprises in the country. Through interviews
                                    with entrepreneurs, experts, workshops with ecosystem actors and analysis of
                                    secondary data, it was found that the main area of activity of these enterprises has
                                    been green technologies (46%), citizenship (43%), education ( 36%), followed by
                                    health (26%), financial services (23%) and cities (23%).Of these enterprises, 42%
                                    had not yet received investments and 35% had not yet earned any value. In 2016 and
                                    2017, 69 impact investing operations were recorded in Brazil, totaling US$ 131
                                    million. These investments were concentrated in the information and communication
                                    technologies (ICT) sector, in line with global trends, totaling US$ 54 million in 16
                                    businesses. According to the 2018 Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs (ANDE)
                                    Impact Investing Impact report, approximately half of these deals were under US$
                                    250,000. Thus, the purpose of this track is to foster and stimulate research on
                                    social enterprises and hybrid organizations. By promoting more in-depth analysis on
                                    the performance and development of social entrepreneurship and hybrid organizations
                                    in Brazil, this proposal aims not only to understand the performance of these
                                    enterprises more robustly, but also to illuminate, from different analysis prisms,
                                    the aspects that have conditioned the management and performance of these
                                    initiatives as important as they are emerging in the national context.

                                    The term Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) emerged in 2002 from the 6th EU
                                    Framework Program for Research and Technological Development (FP6), which is a set
                                    of
                                    actions at the European Union level to fund and promote research. (European
                                    Commission,
                                    2002). In the document, responsibility link to ethical issues (networking between
                                    existing bodies and activities, promoting dialogue in a global context,
                                    awareness-raising, training, research on ethics concerning science and technology)
                                    and
                                    uncertainty, risk and precautionary principle. (analysis and best practices). Over
                                    the
                                    last decade, the concept of innovation has driven much of the European research
                                    agenda
                                    (European Commission, 2013).<br />
                                    The global concern for the planet, its natural resources, as well as a just and
                                    inclusive society, motivate the responsibility in research and innovation (United
                                    Nations, 2015). This concept concerns governments, which can act through policies
                                    and
                                    regulations even though they are still in the development phase (Scherer, Palazzo, &
                                    Baumann, 2006). However, it also concerns private enterprise (Burget et al.,
                                    2016).<br />
                                    In practice, RRI aims to shape, maintain, develop, coordinate and align existing and
                                    innovative processes, actors and responsibilities related to innovation and
                                    research, to
                                    ensure desirable and acceptable research results (Stahl, 2013). It is therefore
                                    about
                                    developing new products and services that combine growth, performance and
                                    accountability. This responsibility is directed at customers and users as well as
                                    the
                                    ecosystem as a whole (Pavie, & Carthy, 2015).<br />
                                    In considering innovation as a process, RRI denotes guidance for anticipation,
                                    inclusion, responsiveness and reflexivity (Van Oudheusden, 2014). These four
                                    dimensions
                                    imply a collective and continuous commitment to being (Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten,
                                    2013). Anticipation describes and analyzes the intended and potentially unintended
                                    economic, social, environmental or other impacts that may arise and is underpinned
                                    by
                                    methodologies that include forecasting, technology assessment and scenario
                                    development
                                    (Owen, et al. 2013). Reflection reflects on the underlying purposes, motivations,
                                    and
                                    potential impacts of what is known (including the areas of regulation, ethical
                                    review,
                                    or other forms of governance that may exist) and what is not known (associated
                                    uncertainties, risks, areas of ignorance, assumptions, questions and dilemmas)
                                    (Owen, et
                                    al. 2013). Inclusion refers to diminished expert authority, with the inclusion of
                                    new
                                    voices in the governance of science and innovation as part of a quest for
                                    legitimation
                                    Owen, et al. 2013). Responsiveness requires an ability to change shape or direction
                                    in
                                    response to stakeholder and public values and changing circumstances. Responsiveness
                                    is,
                                    therefore, to make inevitable adjustments to innovation trajectories as they
                                    progress
                                    and mobilize the expectations of all stakeholders (Demers-Payette et al.,
                                    2016).<br />
                                    The field is broad and can be studied from the perspective of research developed at
                                    universities and research centers, in the context of public policies to encourage
                                    innovation and innovation developed through public initiative.

                                    The role played by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in national economies and
                                    societies around the world is paramount (OECD, 2017). Usually, they account for 99%
                                    of
                                    all businesses in a country (OECD/ETF/EU/EBRD, 2019) and are responsible for large
                                    contributions to GDP and employment (OECD, 2017). In Brazil, half of all formal jobs
                                    are
                                    sustained by small businesses which altogether produce a quarter of the country’s
                                    GDP
                                    (SEBRAE, 2018). These numbers, which can be much higher in developed countries
                                    (Edinburgh Group, 2013) indicate that SMEs support the growth of a strong middle
                                    class
                                    and increase the quality of life of entire populations. <br />
                                    The critical role played by SMEs, both socially and economically, and the threats
                                    they
                                    face, justify the efforts made to deepen understanding of the causes and the nature
                                    of
                                    their survival and growth. Therefore, the growth of small businesses is one of the
                                    main
                                    subjects in entrepreneurship research (Marvel, Davis, & Sproul, 2016). It is
                                    acknowledged that growth increases the chance of business survival and that the
                                    inability to expand is directly related to firm failure (McKelvie & Wiklund, 2010;
                                    Rauch
                                    & Rijsdijk, 2013).<br />
                                    SME growth, for both low- and high-tech businesses, is influenced by internal and
                                    external elements to the firm. The availability of human capital (e.g. Colombo &
                                    Grilli,
                                    2005) and financial resources (Cowling, Brown, & Rocha, 2020), as well as the
                                    development of the firm's capabilities (e.g. Parida, Pesämaa, Wincent, & Westerberg,
                                    2017), are examples of important predictors of this phenomenon. Additionally, the
                                    context can reveal conditions and possibilities for discovering, creating and
                                    exploring
                                    innovations (Ngoasong, 2018). Therefore, recent research has used, for instance, the
                                    innovation ecosystem as a lens of analysis for the creation of new businesses and to
                                    foster entrepreneurial action (Gomes, Facin, Salerno, & Ikenami, 2018).<br />
                                    However, the research on SME growth has proven to be particularly difficult
                                    (Shepherd &
                                    Wiklund, 2009). Few advances/breakthroughs have been made and convergences in the
                                    field
                                    are much rarer than fragmented results, due to multiple obstacles mostly stemming
                                    from
                                    inconsistent definitions, sampling challenges, and from the phenomenological
                                    complexity
                                    inherent to the growth process per se that makes it difficult to draw overarching
                                    conclusions (Demir, Wennberg, & McKelvie, 2017). <br />
                                    In this session, we focus on different aspects of the research on SME performance:
                                    birth, mortality, survival, growth, and scaling. We welcome qualitative,
                                    quantitative

                                    The Fourth Industrial Revolution strengthened the importance of culture and
                                    technical,
                                    behavioral and functional competences that must be improved during all years of
                                    study.
                                    In addition, the generic skills that enable successful participation in innovation
                                    and
                                    entrepreneurship processes are highly valued. The importance of innovations is
                                    clear, as
                                    companies and organizations continually seek out innovative employees. Companies
                                    need
                                    innovations to create competitiveness and the public sector to produce high-quality
                                    and
                                    cost-effective services (Keinänen and Kairisto-Mertanen, 2019). Thus, there is a
                                    need
                                    for professionals who are able to participate in innovation processes and who can
                                    contribute to the creation of innovations (Hero and Lindfors, 2019). However, “the
                                    role
                                    of higher education is not only to train undergraduate students for future work, but
                                    also to train future employees to perform work tasks, which then generate
                                    innovations”
                                    (Keinänen and Kairisto-Mertanen, 2019, p. 17). Thus, this poses challenges to the
                                    ways
                                    of educating, since we need changes in all the main stages of education: planning,
                                    implementation and evaluation of learning outcomes (Lappalainen, 2018).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    More and more discussions on how to prepare people and environments to become more
                                    innovative and entrepreneurial are gaining ground in the academic and managerial
                                    context.<br />

                                    From the seminal contribution of Schumpeter (1912; 1942), in which innovation is
                                    given
                                    the main role in the generation of economic development, new advances have been made
                                    to
                                    better understand this phenomenon. Systemic approaches to innovation strategies have
                                    been reported in the literature in various forms, ranging from the most classical
                                    view
                                    of innovation systems to more contemporary concepts, such as innovation ecosystems
                                    (ADNER; KAPOOR, 2010; 2016). Based on the study by Moore (1993), who coined the term
                                    business ecosystems, taking the construct “ecosystem” to the social sciences, the
                                    concepts of innovation ecosystems (IE) were born (ADNER, 2006) and entrepreneurial
                                    ecosystems (EE) (ISENBERG, 2010). The first is usually used to explain innovative
                                    activities with a wide variety of actors, who cooperate to create value that they
                                    would
                                    not be able individually (ADNER, 2006). Thus, in IS, the “eco” emphasizes relational
                                    dynamics and the resulting creation of value (RITALA; ALMPANOUPOULOU, 2017). In EE,
                                    on
                                    the other hand, there is a set of elements (leadership, market, customers, culture,
                                    etc.) that relate to each other, driving the creation and development of
                                    entrepreneurial
                                    activity (ISENBERG, 2010). Since then, the use of these terms has grown and
                                    criticism
                                    has emerged regarding conceptual ambiguity about ecosystem research, due to the
                                    variation in the definition of limits and levels of analysis of the phenomena
                                    (RITALA;
                                    GUSTAFSSON, 2018). Also, the concepts have received criticism for the lack of
                                    theoretical consistency and empirical evidence that corroborates the need for a new
                                    term
                                    (OH et al., 2016; SCARINGELLA; RADZIWON, 2017; GOMES et al., 2018; BOGERS et al
                                    2019).
                                    Thus, although the ecosystem approach has gained space in the literature on
                                    strategy,
                                    innovation, and entrepreneurship, there is no consensus on the definition of the
                                    concepts originated from it (GOMES et al., 2018). The diversity of concepts and
                                    empirical applications that emerge in this context highlights the theoretical and
                                    methodological challenges of the area and also highlights the opportunities for
                                    future
                                    research. Thus, despite the advances made in recent years (GOMES et al., 2018;
                                    BOGERS;
                                    SIMS, 2019; SUOMINEN; SEPPÄNEN; DEDEHAYR, 2019; VOLKMER MARTINS et al. 2019;
                                    GRANSTRAND;
                                    HOLGERSSON, 2020), which contributed to increase the robustness of the concepts,
                                    several
                                    gaps remain open, mainly regarding the understanding of these phenomena in emerging
                                    countries like Brazil. Thus, this theme brings together theoretical and empirical
                                    studies that contemplate:<br />

                                    Doing a lot with little is much frequently employed in entrepreneurship, even more
                                    in
                                    crises situations (Kuckertz et al., 2020; Nelson and Lima, 2020; Kwong et al., 2019;
                                    Tsilika et al., 2020). This implies using bricolage (Baker and Nelson, 2005) and
                                    effectuation (Sarasvathy, 2001; Sarasvathy et al., 2020) – also according to Fisher
                                    (2012) – this later one occurs if there is also limitation of the risks to an
                                    acceptable

                                    Making digital business is also very common (Zaheer et al., 2019) and tends to be an
                                    even more disseminated practice as digital technologies develop and become more
                                    accessible (Allen, 2019; Nambisan, 2017). Making the transition for digital
                                    operations
                                    (e.g. creating your own delivery system using online resources or adhering to iFood
                                    or
                                    Rappi) or making digital adaptations (e.g. increasing the communication and offer
                                    items
                                    on internet) is also a solution to improve sales and diminish costs, which are
                                    important
                                    solutions to face crises (Dwivedi et al., 2020; Kuckertz et al., 2020; Papadopoulos
                                    et
                                    al., 2020). Against a pandemic crisis (e.g. H1N1, covid-19, etc.), digital options
                                    are
                                    also useful diminishing physical proximity of people and contagion risks. Using

                                    technologies facing crises is favored by effectuation and/or bricolage (e.g.

                                    al., 2020) even in conditions of great poverty because they count on cheap and

                                    available technological means. They support resilience for entrepreneurship and

                                    Social innovation is a well-established field in both Europe and North America. This
                                    is
                                    a (sub) field that forms at the intersection of the socio-technical approach to
                                    developing "new social practices" to manage social demands. In the last ten years,
                                    institutions that defined technological and social policies such as the OECD and the
                                    European Community (via BEPA) have established an institutional framework for the
                                    (sub)
                                    field's central concept. In developing countries (Global South), which constitute a
                                    wide
                                    field for this new perspective, using a constructive approach to responses to social
                                    demands with a theoretical foundation is still in the consolidation phase. It
                                    requires
                                    new arrangements of actors (or "practices "when under another lens).<br />
                                    Although there is widespread recognition of social innovation's need, its idea is
                                    still
                                    complex due to several definitions and lack of a comprehensive theoretical
                                    foundation.
                                    Then, it can be seen that there is still no clear understanding of how social
                                    innovation
                                    leads to social change, the conditions that govern its creation, its genesis,
                                    dissemination, and acceptance, without clearly distinguishing it from other forms of
                                    innovation. Thus, it is considered that this field, still in consolidation in
                                    Brazil,
                                    has concrete paths for its expansion, being possible different theoretical-empirical
                                    discussions. Among the possibilities for expanding the debate, the following stand

                                    (Mulgan, Tucker, Ali & Sanders, 2007; Souza, Lessa & Lazaro, 2019);<br />

                                    Such approaches result from a comprehensive and integrated understanding of social
                                    innovations, including different actors, sectors of society, research areas, and
                                    application fields, thus demonstrating that broadening the perspective is crucial
                                    for
                                    understanding social innovation (Scoppetta, Butzin & Rehfeld, 2014; Ziegler,
                                    2017).<br />
                                    Therefore, the purpose of this theme is to stimulate academic research about
                                    theoretical-empirical advances on social innovations, considering their dimensions
                                    and
                                    practices, as well as the transformations resulting from their development. It seeks
                                    to
                                    facilitate dialogues with research that explore the local and Brazilian reality and
                                    works with a broader, abstract, and theoretical approach. Given the presence of
                                    articles
                                    with this theme in the last five years in EnANPAD, it is believed that this proposal
                                    is
                                    relevant to researchers and research groups in the proposed area, as well as new
                                    researchers in this process of consolidating the (sub) field.<br />

                                    Innovation is an area of ??intense research in the academic world in areas that
                                    integrate economics, administration, engineering and law, among others. It has
                                    attracted
                                    increasing attention from companies and governments as an engine of long-term
                                    economic
                                    and social development.<br />
                                    Research has provided a comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon and one of the
                                    fields that has been focused on over the past decades is that of public policy.
                                    Namely
                                    in the context of innovation and entrepreneurship policies in different contexts,
                                    such
                                    as nations, states, municipalities or industries in particular.<br />
                                    In Brazil, the last few years have been fruitful for the debate and formulation of
                                    public innovation policies. In this context, it is possible to highlight the
                                    Constitutional Amendment 15/85, the Multiyear Plans and the National CT&I Strategy
                                    (ENCTI) and the so-called “legal framework of innovation” regulated by Decree No.

                                    of 2018.<br />
                                    This situation demonstrates that a significant number of contributions on innovation
                                    and
                                    entrepreneurship policies still need to be investigated and debated.<br />
                                    In this sense, with the aim of creating subsidies for innovation and
                                    entrepreneurship
                                    policy makers at a time when many of them are under review due to their period of
                                    validity and the perspectives under construction in the current federal government

                                    Universities or Institutes of Technology<br />

                                    Social networks develop over time based on formal and informal exchanges between
                                    actors.
                                    Such networks are known to be critical for entrepreneurs and innovation managers to
                                    identify new opportunities and organize their networks according to their needs
                                    (JOHANNISSON & HUSE, 2000), as they shape the flow of information and trace the
                                    bonds
                                    through which ideals, knowledge and financial capital flow. Stuart and Sorenson
                                    (2005)
                                    argue that the position of individuals and firms in networks impacts the
                                    opportunities
                                    to start new businesses and the limitations they face. Studies on individual-level
                                    entrepreneur networks focus on entrepreneurs' own relationships or ties with other
                                    individuals or organizations, acting as agents of the firm (ANDERSON & MILLER, 2003;
                                    BATJARGAL, 2003; SHANE & CABLE, 2002). In addition, the entrepreneur's initial ties
                                    influence the economic decisions of the new venture as result of being immersed in
                                    the
                                    entrepreneur's social relationships (GRANOVETTER, 1973). In addition, dormant ties
                                    can
                                    be a source of knowledge and social capital, since when reconnected they are more
                                    valuable (Walter et al., 2015), these weak nodes give rise to non-redundant
                                    information
                                    that enables development and differentiation (GRANOVETTER, 1973), strengthening the
                                    generation of innovation opportunities and entrepreneurship. It also highlights the
                                    importance of knowledge base generated in developing countries with market failures
                                    and
                                    institutional weaknesses (GIULIANI, 2013), as is the case of Brazil. In
                                    entrepreneurship, issues related to the emergence and development of networks, their
                                    governance and impacts on financing and growth of new ventures are also relevant.
                                    The
                                    present theme proposal seeks to raise the debate on different perspectives of social
                                    networks and implications for knowledge flow, entrepreneurship and innovation. This
                                    theme is critical to the success of innovative endeavors, which depends on how well
                                    actors are able to proactively adapt their networks and deal with the consequences
                                    of
                                    turnover. Theoretical essays and empirical work on social networks are

                                    Desde o último quartil do século XX, os países industrializados passaram a
                                    fortalecer a
                                    base de conhecimento de suas economias, em função do novo paradigma
                                    técnico-econômico
                                    baseado na difusão das tecnologias de informação e comunicação (HARVEY, 1992). Surge
                                    então a noção de “economia baseada no conhecimento”na qual a inovação passa a ser o
                                    elemento que proporciona vantagens competitivas às empresas e que se torna objetivo
                                    primordial das políticas econômicas dos países (ETZKOWITZ, 2008; PORTER,
                                    1998).<br />
                                    Essa nova economia é organizada em rede e os atores institucionais, como a
                                    Universidade
                                    (U), as empresas do setor produtivo de bens e serviços (E), o Governo (G) nos seus
                                    diferentes níveis, e entidades organizadas da sociedade civil(S), que executam seus
                                    papeis natos respectivos de geração e transmissão do conhecimento, produção de bens
                                    e
                                    serviços (B/S) e regulação da atividade econômica, e também, a partir de múltiplas
                                    interações, assumem novos papéis havendo sobreposição, retroalimentação e o
                                    surgimento
                                    de dinâmicas não-lineares em espaços híbridos e de consenso (ETZKOWITZ; LEYDESDORFF,
                                    2000; CARAYANNIS; BARTH; CAMPBELL, 2014; CARAYANNIS; CAMPBELL 2010). <br />

                                    Quadruple Helix, que se refletem na emergência de mecanismos e ambientes de
                                    inovação,
                                    como as incubadoras de empresas, os parques científicos, tecnológicos e de inovação,
                                    os
                                    hubs de inovação, além dos escritórios de transferência e comercialização de
                                    tecnologia,
                                    das redes de P&D&I colaborativa, projetos de desenvolvimento econômico regional
                                    (arranjos e sistemas produtivos e inovativos locais), distritos de inovação, entre
                                    outros (ETZKOWITZ, 2008; AMARAL, 2015). <br />
                                    Estes modelos refletem o processo de geração, apropriação e difusão do conhecimento
                                    científico tecnológico e neste aspecto a emergência de modelos como a inovação
                                    aberta
                                    (Open Innovation) permite a melhor gestão de tais fluxos resultando em impactos
                                    positivos para o desenvolvimento tecnológico, econômico e social.<br />

                                    Innovation management is a topic that continues to generate debates, either among
                                    academics or practitioners. On the one hand, Brazilian and international researchers
                                    keep investigating and generating concrete information about how various
                                    organizational
                                    arrangements can handle innovation. On the other hand, there is a growing interest
                                    of
                                    managers and practitioners in creating, adopting and developing structures, methods
                                    and
                                    techniques (Hidalgo & Albors, 2008) to manage innovation within organizations.<br />
                                    Innovation management concerns how organizations deal with creating, diffusing, or
                                    adopting innovations. While in a macro perspective innovation processes go through
                                    stages of variation, selection and retention (Garud et al., 2013), at the firm level
                                    they encompass phases such as design, development, testing, adoption, and diffusion
                                    (Van
                                    de Ven et al., 2000). Silva et al. (2014, p. 488) identify a plurality of approaches
                                    on
                                    managing innovation processes and reinforce the idea that they should go beyond the
                                    visual representation of a model, i.e. should be grounded on "solid conceptual
                                    foundations about their limits, objectives, competitive and strategic context, and
                                    organizational parameters".<br />
                                    Although studies on innovation have been characterized by interdisciplinarity,
                                    traditionally, the understanding of innovation management used to be strongly
                                    related to
                                    the management of technological innovation. However, to understand the various
                                    nuances
                                    of innovation management, classic works (Joe Tidd, 2001; Utterback, 1994) as well as
                                    recent ones (Damanpour, 2020; OECD, 2018; Skudienê et al., 2020; J. Tidd & Bessant,
                                    2018) highlight factors ranging from strategic to operational, from incremental to
                                    disruptive, from conception to measurement, from closed to open, as well as ways of
                                    dealing with innovations ranging from technological to non-technological ones.<br />
                                    Innovation management should not be seen as a simple sequence of stages or
                                    cumulative
                                    phases (Van de Ven et al., 2000) and becomes more complex in an increasingly
                                    competitive
                                    scenario and in the midst of the emergence of models, tools and methods to support
                                    innovation decision-making processes. This theme proposal seeks to raise the debate
                                    on
                                    different perspectives and approaches on innovation management and its implications
                                    within the organizational environment. Topics of interest include conceptual and
                                    empirical approaches (both quantitative and qualitative) on the following

                                    open innovation in private and public agents;<br />
                                    4. Management of innovation in its various typologies, such as technological,
                                    managerial
                                    and social;<br />
                                    5. Integration of innovation management with strategies and decision-making

                                    The circular economy presupposes adherence to business models that make it possible
                                    to contribute to the circularity of materials throughout the production chains. The
                                    intention is to retain value by retaining resources in supply chains. The shorter
                                    the cycle to reintroduce material into the same supply chain or another, the greater
                                    the value that is retained. Following this prerogative, the 10Rs illustrate the
                                    potential value retention of resources, through the practices of refusal, reduction,
                                    reuse / resale, repair, renovation, remanufacturing, reuse with new function /
                                    purpose, recycling, energy recovery and re-extraction of resources. For these
                                    practices to become viable and possible in organizations, it requires the engagement
                                    of different actors, the integration of innovation and the premises of circularity
                                    in the organizations' strategy and operations. This demands an organizational
                                    culture aligned with the precepts of the circular economy. Demands new non-financial
                                    metrics for measuring circularity levels, the need for management guided by ethical,
                                    social and environmental values. Thus, the proposed theme is subdivided into
                                    different topics, detailed below:<br />
                                    Background to the circular economy. Circular economy practices. Transition from the

                                    example, rent, leasing, process virtualization, shared savings. The social dimension
                                    in the circular economy. Reformulation of products and supply chains for the
                                    circular economy. Modularization and cascading. Reuse of products, components and
                                    materials. Circular economy and communication with the market. Sustainable cities

                                    the circular economy. Eco-design. Reduction. Reuse. Recycling. Reclassification.
                                    Renewal (renewable energies). Public policies towards the circular economy.

                                    the circular economy. Integration of the circular economy with Industry 4.0. The
                                    role of the circular economy in emergency situations. Artificial intelligence and

                                    The "Project Management" track includes research and academic work related to the
                                    unit of analysis called "project", which can be defined as a temporary effort to
                                    create a product, service or unique result, carried out in an organization or in a
                                    set of organizations, with deadlines, resources and with a defined scope. Its
                                    importance can be highlighted by the need of organizations, public or private, to
                                    properly implement their projects to fulfill the strategic objectives that originate
                                    to them. Without proper project management, new ideas, processes or products will
                                    remain on paper and their benefits will not come true. In this context,
                                    opportunities have arisen inside and outside the academy to improve procedures and /
                                    or integrate disciplines such as, for example, the application of hybrid methods.
                                    From this understanding the following lines of work are proposed: Projects as
                                    temporary organizations; Project management methodologies; Tools and techniques of
                                    project management; The Project manager; Strategic project management; Maturity in
                                    project management; Project programs and portfolios; Performance, benefits and
                                    success of projects; International projects; Megaprojects; Governance and
                                    organizational structures for projects; Project offices; Lessons learned from
                                    projects; Teaching and training in project management; Agile project management
                                    methods; Projects in the public sector; Project-based organizations; Cases in
                                    projects: cultural projects, social, environmental, humanitarian aid; Historical
                                    projects; and Sustainability and project management.

                                    inter-organizational aspects, a new viewpoint at the moral behaviour of managers and
                                    ethics among members of the supply chain (Beske and Seuring, 2014). The current
                                    debate in this context demonstrates greater emphasis of studies on environmental
                                    concerns; however social issues raise as the greatest challenge for operations
                                    management (Yawar and Seuring, 2017). <br />
                                    To minimize the concentration of discussions in North American and European
                                    countries (Gold and Schleper, 2017), the debate is opened towards developing
                                    countries, especially in the context of Latin America, where there are several
                                    aspects that should be considered in the quest for sustainability (Fritz and Silva,
                                    2018). For these authors, sustainable development goals (SDG) can be considered,
                                    which would lead, for example, to more poverty reduction studies (SDG # 1) and more
                                    sustainable production and consumption (SDG # 12).<br />
                                    Alongside the need to advance towards business models that produce lower
                                    socioenvironmental impact, society calls for transparency – i.e. allowing consumers
                                    and other stakeholders to understand the firm’s list of suppliers, provenance of raw
                                    materials, and data regarding socioenvironmental impact (Marshall et al., 2016).
                                    Recent studies show that in order develop sustainable and transparent business
                                    models, it becomes critical to embrace voices from diverse stakeholders that are
                                    part of the broader supply network (Marques, 2019).<br />
                                    Additionally, it is also important to consider aspects that have emerged as barriers
                                    to sustainability in operations and supply chains, in different contexts, such as,
                                    for example, corruption, which can be a challenge to be overcome (Silvestre et al.,
                                    2018) or even a practice to circumvent the adoption of sustainability standards
                                    (Silvestre, Viana and Monteiro, 2020).<br />
                                    From this view, among the possible topics involved are:<br />
                                    - relationship between CSR, SDGs and business performance<br />
                                    - models and processes aiming transparency in supply networks<br />
                                    - methods and criteria for socio-environmental selection and monitoring of
                                    suppliers<br />
                                    - social technologies and new technologies such as blockchain and their impact to
                                    supply chain management<br />
                                    - human and labour rights in the operations management (e.g., Modern Slavery)<br />
                                    - socio-environmental certifications - motivations, implementation and results (e.g.
                                    Fair Trade, Carbon-zero)<br />
                                    - product life cycle assessment, green supply chain management and closed loop
                                    supply chain, new circular economy impacts of products and business models<br />
                                    - shared responsibility and its impact on operations<br />
                                    - corruption in operations and supply chains<br />
                                    These themes demonstrate multiple possibilities to develop research on this theme.
                                    Thus, we invite all the academic community engaged with sustainability in operations
                                    management, in intra- and inter-organizational context, to submit their papers and
                                    technical reports in order to advance the debate on this subject.

                                    The term global value chains (GVC) is an approach that analyses the phenomenon of
                                    the slicing of production processes between actors located in several countries.
                                    COVID-19 pandemic showed the fragility of these chains and also that there is much
                                    to be done, also in research. At the same time, the world faces challenges in the
                                    climate theme, which, if they existed before, have become more urgent. Not only the
                                    media (The Economist, 2020), but also the state of the art of research (Oldekop et
                                    al. 2020) deal with the themes. Although the two issues do not seem directly
                                    connected at first sight, pandemic and the environment, in addition to having causes
                                    and processes that go beyond national borders, their consequences have similar
                                    characteristics. Therefore, the challenges are global, involving several countries
                                    and the consequences occur not only in the field of development, but also of the
                                    organizations, directly and indirectly involved. In addition to these two themes,
                                    pandemic and the environment, it must be considered that digitization has
                                    accelerated not only in various economic sectors, but also in many daily activities
                                    (Oldekop et al., 2020). Digitization has also supported the containment of the
                                    pandemic in Asian countries (Huang, Sun, & Sui, 2020). <br />
                                    In GVCs and Global Production Networks (GPNs), production occurs through a sequence
                                    of activities, each of which adds some value to what was added by the previous
                                    links. The sequence of these activities is described and analyzed from conception to
                                    production and end use, as well as examining the relationship between work
                                    performed, technologies, standards, regulations, products, processes and markets of
                                    each specific location, in order to understand how they interrelate and influence,
                                    as well as the structure and dynamics of the chains (Gereffi & Fernandez-Stark,
                                    2016). <br />
                                    In this way, GVC gives particular attention to the question of how and why the
                                    distribution of activities between regions and countries allows each link to take
                                    over the value generated along the chain. It focuses on the fact that firms and
                                    productive groupings in emerging countries often engage in activities that allow
                                    them take over much less value than the counterparts from the developed world
                                    (Kaplinsky & Morris, 2016). It asks why this is so and seeks solutions to this
                                    phenomenon, which negatively affects the possibility of economic, social and
                                    environmental upgrading of these countries. It is, therefore, an approach that is of
                                    particular interest to emerging and / or developing countries, as is the case in
                                    Brazil. In recent literature, there are examples of upgrading of companies from
                                    emerging countries, showing that this is not an impossible task (Peng, Zeng,
                                    Collinson, Wu, & Wu, 2020). The question that can be asked and investigated is
                                    whether and how the events mentioned, pandemic, environment and digitalization, mean
                                    a new window of opportunity for companies in emerging countries. In this sense, the
                                    GVC-GPN themes can be associated with global strategies, in order to synergize
                                    common concepts and mechanisms, especially regarding upgrading and strategic
                                    evolution (Pananond, Gereffi, & Torbensen, 2020).<br />

                                    Supply Chain Management (SCM) has progressed from integrating business processes
                                    between
                                    different links in the chain (Cooper, Lambert & Pagh, 1997) to a systemic and
                                    strategic
                                    vision, implemented by two or more companies, aiming at increasing customer
                                    satisfaction, reducing costs and obtaining competitive advantage for the chain as a
                                    whole (Mentzer et al., 2001). SCM encompasses different processes, such as
                                    Purchasing
                                    and Supplier Management, Demand Management, Order Fulfillment, Customer Relations
                                    and
                                    Logistics, which must be aligned in terms of strategies, processes and metrics with
                                    the
                                    functional areas of Marketing, Operations and Production (Mentzer et al, 2008,
                                    Christopher & Ryals, 2014). In this way, SCM assumes information sharing and
                                    integrated
                                    planning between demand and supply, covering Supplies, Operation and Distribution to
                                    deliver greater value to the end customer (Christopher & Ryals 2014; Tate et al,
                                    2015).<br />
                                    For Min, Zacharia and Smith (2019), key elements of the original proposal for SCM
                                    remain
                                    relevant and contemporary: its strategic nature, the creation of value for the
                                    client,
                                    the systemic and strategic vision of organizations and intra and interorganizational
                                    collaboration. However, it is important that SCM studies assess the adaptation of
                                    this
                                    management to market trends and new technologies (Christopher & Ryals, 2014; Min et
                                    al,
                                    2019), in addition to people, environmental, social / ethical issues and risks and
                                    resilience (Wieland et al, 2016).<br />

                                    The changes caused by the global and accelerated spread of Covid-19 have amplified
                                    the
                                    attention of academics, government officials, civil society, and professionals (in
                                    several areas) to the risks of disruptions in operations and supply chains as the
                                    consequences that they can have generated. This theme is on the agenda of calls for
                                    research in several academic journals, in the political debates, in the tensions of
                                    companies negotiations, in executive meetings on the future of management practices,
                                    in
                                    the race of distribution channels for digitalization of offering products or
                                    services to
                                    buyers or end consumers.<br />
                                    In this theme, we intend to stimulate studies looking at these multidimensions (i.
                                    e.,
                                    social systems, supply chains, organizations, and individuals) by considering that
                                    risks
                                    generally do not occur in isolation because, in large proportions, they generate
                                    numerous cascading effects.<br />
                                    Although to know the sources of risks, their consequences and mitigation strategies
                                    are
                                    becoming relevant (Juttner, 2003; Diabat et al., 2012; Heckmann et al., 2015; Fan
                                    and
                                    Stevenson, 2018). It is assumed that there is no possibility of mitigating all
                                    sources
                                    of risks that affect society, businesses, and relationships that exist in it. That
                                    is a
                                    low probability that risks can happen more frequently, and their impacts are already
                                    felt at higher costs when they affect multiple regions or globally as now (WEF,
                                    2006;
                                    2020). Risk management and resilience in organizations and supply chains are others
                                    point of transformation. Risk and resilience management in organizations and supply
                                    chains are transformation points and are no longer considered fashionable or
                                    emerging
                                    issues. Therefore, risk and resilience were consolidated as necessary, and this need
                                    can
                                    be confirmed by the large number of publications made in the last decade (IJOPM,
                                    2019;
                                    JOM, 2020; OMR, 2020) or even with a dedicated look at this theme (IJSCOR, 2014;

                                    The relationship between operations and innovation is often treated in the
                                    literature as
                                    antagonistic. If, on the one hand, operations can be considered ordinary
                                    capabilities
                                    that reinforce core competences and core-rigidities subject to “disruptions”, on the
                                    other hand, operations form the competitive basis through which new capabilities can
                                    be
                                    built following a certain technological trajectory. This relationship is especially
                                    important in developing countries where the gain in competitiveness is commonly
                                    obtained
                                    by adopting operational know-how that fosters the strategic process of catching-up
                                    and
                                    technological upgrading. This track aims to discuss the relationship between
                                    operations,
                                    innovation and competitiveness.<br />

                                    Issues such as:<br />
                                    • What is the relationship between operations and innovation? What is the direction
                                    of
                                    this relationship?<br />
                                    • How can operations foster different types of innovation?<br />
                                    • How do companies nurture and build operational capabilities to achieve
                                    competitiveness
                                    in the 21st century?<br />
                                    • What are the business, regional or market determinants for building operational
                                    and
                                    competitive capabilities?<br />
                                    • How to innovate through operations and gain competitiveness?<br />
                                    • How companies build on operations capabilities to develop new products and
                                    services?<br />
                                    • How do traditional concepts in the field of operations, such as design for
                                    manufacturing, design for quality, involvement of suppliers in product design and
                                    modularity, fit into this context?<br />
                                    To answer these questions, this section accepts case studies as well as quantitative
                                    studies.

                                    Due to the importance of services in economies, researchers from different fields
                                    began
                                    to turn their attention to services. Since the 1970s, researchers have explored how
                                    and
                                    why products and services differ in relation to development, production and
                                    commercialization processes. Currently, the importance of services goes beyond the
                                    traditional service sectors (for example, health, hospitality, transport, etc.),
                                    since
                                    many industrial companies have invested in the greater offer of services as a way to
                                    increase their competitive advantage. Thus, research on services has grown and won
                                    specific journals, such as the Journal of Service Research, Journal of Services
                                    Management, Journal of Service Theory and Practice, Service Science and The Services
                                    Industries Journal. In the field of operations, services have also gained the
                                    attention
                                    of researchers due to the diverse nuances of the service operation. Added to this,
                                    the
                                    challenges imposed by new technologies (for example, internet of things, artificial
                                    intelligence and robotics) that have been transforming operations into services.
                                    Thus,
                                    this theme aims to explore topics related to the management of service operations in
                                    organizations that operate in Business-to-business (B2B) and Business-to-consumers /
                                    users (B2C) markets, whether in the public or private sphere. We also expect to

                                    to name a few. It is also worth mentioning service operations in industrial

                                    The theme is aimed at fostering the production and sharing of studies, research and
                                    discussions around the Leadership phenomenon, based on the societal, organizational
                                    and individual dimensions. The scope includes analysis of traditional, critical and
                                    contemporary approaches on the theme, particularly approaches, leadership styles and
                                    forms of its development in contexts marked by demographic, geopolitical,
                                    technological, behavioral and organizational transformations. It also includes
                                    studies that seek the production of theories and approaches considering
                                    characteristics and specificities of the Brazilian reality, as well as empirical
                                    research that emphasizes it, as well as proposing comparisons with other
                                    socioeconomic and cultural contexts. It also involves space for the discussion of
                                    theoretical-methodological and conceptual approaches that understand or extrapolate
                                    the mainstream of studies on the subject, with emphasis on permanences, changes,
                                    paradoxes and dilemmas around the theoretical production around the construct, and
                                    its articulations with national reality. Among the set of topics and subtopics
                                    include theoretical and empirical studies covering classical and emerging
                                    approaches, leadership and critical perspectives, relationships between leadership
                                    and power, leadership and culture, leadership and management, leadership and

                                    The purpose of the discussion proposed in this theme is to foster contact with
                                    current discussions in the field of organizational studies in the dimensions that
                                    encompass the individual, group and organization. Faced with such a vast, diverse
                                    and fragmented field, several cut-outs are possible. Thus, it is proposed to discuss
                                    and reflect on some organizational phenomena and processes that constitute the
                                    object of intense academic and professional interest in the current context of
                                    changes in the world of work and analyze how individual diversity impacts on the
                                    construction of the quality of the relationship between workers and organizations.
                                    .<br />
                                    Understanding what is organizational behavior is fundamental for the assessment of
                                    the environment and for the adoption of effective people management practices. In
                                    addition, it helps to guide the performance of managers and leaders in order to
                                    create favorable conditions for better individual and collective performance. Such
                                    understanding involves the use of new diagnostic tools, especially those involving
                                    more robust methods, such as modeling applied to the study of organizational
                                    behavior.<br />
                                    Thus, based on the theme of organizational behavior, some common subthemes are
                                    proposed and are still of interest to researchers: a) Motivation and satisfaction;
                                    b) Perception and decision making; c) communication; d) Power (authority and
                                    autonomy); e) Conflicts at work; f) Social Skills; g) Values ??(personal,
                                    professional, at work, organizational); h) Commitment, work bonds, entrenchment; (i)
                                    organizational justice; j) Ethics; l) Work teams; m) Organizational Citizenship
                                    Behavior; n) Organizational Support; o) Engagement; p) Identity; r) New tools for
                                    diagnosing organizational behavior; s) Multilevel Modeling applied to the study of
                                    organizational behavior and t) Changes in post-pandemic organizational behavior
                                    phenomena by COVID-19.<br />

                                    In the past few decades, organizations have undergone all kinds of changes at an
                                    increasingly rapid pace. The uncertainties of the environment are increasing, which
                                    leads to different and even contrary interpretations. This increases the complexity
                                    in the field of strategy and creates a great challenge for Human Resource
                                    Management. <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Recently, HR Management has been faced with new challenges due to the advent of the
                                    digital economy, internationalization, the green management of human resources and
                                    now, the pandemic resulting from COVID 19. Changes in the socio-cultural environment
                                    have also affected policies and practices of HR management. The socio-cultural
                                    environment creates tensions that can make them ineffective as quickly as changes in
                                    technology and market. As a consequence, individual and organizational performance
                                    is under intense questioning. <br />

                                    create tensions in HR Management. Such tensions affect policies and practices and
                                    can render them ineffective as quickly as changes in technology and market. As a
                                    consequence, individual and organizational performance has been questioned under
                                    different aspects.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    As changes require organizations to redouble their attention on the external and
                                    internal environment, the models, policies and practices of Human Resource
                                    Management remains active on the agenda of many researchers and has been the subject
                                    of recent publications in the main congresses and scientific journals worldwide.
                                    Therefore, the organizations that are able to manage their human resources more
                                    efficiently and effectively are those that not only adapt to the changing
                                    environments, but also manage to create the conditions for continuous and
                                    sustainable growth over time.<br />

                                    The purpose is to extend and advance the discussion concerning the resignification
                                    of the idea, as well as its challenges and possibilities; the application of
                                    competences with the objective of reviewing the origin of the concept and how it is
                                    being appropriated by theoretical and empirical studies today, since the topic has a
                                    distinctive heterogeneous epistemological nature. <br />
                                    Furthermore, taking into account the classical notions, and extending these to
                                    discussions concerning social-emotional competences, as well as adaptive, universal
                                    and situational competences; and also further contemporary perspectives and
                                    typologies available in the literature (ex: managerial, technical, transversal,
                                    emerging), one observes the need to discuss how to go forward in this debate
                                    today.<br />
                                    The recurring challenge of proposing a more collective, complex discussion, one that
                                    is less tangible, is also a challenge. Thus, the relevance of this proposal is to
                                    build a discussion on how researchers are disseminating and/or changing the
                                    understanding and application of the idea of competencies in organizations.<br />
                                    The perspective of management by competences is also the focus of this topic,
                                    leading to studies that include a general view or, at least, one of the stages of
                                    management by competencies (ex: competences diagnosis, development and supply;
                                    evaluation of performance by competences , reward by competences and competences
                                    certification, trails of learning by competences).<br />
                                    Within the perspective of competence development and competency-based learning
                                    trails, it includes research that addresses discussions of reframing and practices

                                    perspective of formal and informal learning, in different contexts. The discussion
                                    about the challenges and possibilities of learning strategies that involve the
                                    nature of people and their multiple diversities and relationships are also part of
                                    the scope of the theme.<br />
                                    Therefore, the prospect is the presentation of studies that consider old and new
                                    possibilities, impasses and challenges; the evaluation of the effects of adopting
                                    competencies and learning, or management by competences, in the public and private
                                    sectors and in Third Sector organizations as a whole; considering the relations of
                                    strategical, collective and individual aspects. <br />
                                    We shall also consider investigations that contemplate the multilevel perspective of
                                    competences; competences in face of change (digital transformation, innovation, all
                                    arising during the COVID 19 pandemic); variables that influence the
                                    perception/expression of competences; comparative studies on the adoption of
                                    management by competences in different organizations; models of maturity of
                                    management by competences; developments in the practice associated to the model of
                                    management by competences, different perspectives learning. Research with different
                                    methodological approaches may also be considered as a contribution to the discussion
                                    on the topic (mixed approaches, transversal/longitudinal approaches).<br />

                                    The discussion about health at work and in organizations is increasingly
                                    intensifying as
                                    a necessary and important demand, and the Academy appears at the forefront to
                                    expose,
                                    assist and intervene in the development of healthier and more positive practices
                                    that
                                    improve the quality of life in the most different spaces. In this perspective, the
                                    promotion of health, support and protection of workers and the quality of life at
                                    work
                                    can assist in the well-being. In this way, this thematic axis proposes to open and
                                    continue discussions that deal with the theme. Since the health-disease process
                                    related
                                    to the work is complex and changes historically, through technological, social,
                                    economic
                                    and cultural changes. In addition to being a topic that has been studied in Human
                                    Resources Management and Labor Relations, many organizations still tend to
                                    naturalize
                                    and trivialize the elements that affect workers' health and safety, not treating the
                                    harmful aspect of the effects for the individual. In this way, we invite empirical
                                    or
                                    theoretical works, from different epistemological and methodological approaches,
                                    which
                                    seek to foster and advance knowledge about these phenomena beyond the existence of
                                    these
                                    practices in organizations that include, but are not limited to:<br />
                                    1. Health and safety at work<br />

                                    The management of people in the public sector in the context of reform can be
                                    understood
                                    as the definition of policies and guidelines in relation to human capital to
                                    increase
                                    the efficiency of civil servants and, consequently, of the public agency itself
                                    (MARCONI, 2005). When recovering the history of the formation of People Management
                                    in
                                    the public sector in the context of the formation of the Brazilian public
                                    administration, it is clear that the legacy of the formation of the State, which
                                    comes
                                    from the Portuguese colonization, was reflected in people management policies in the
                                    Brazil, considering from the process of allocating public servants, to the retention
                                    actions.<br />
                                    According to Longo (2007), as important as legal changes are, organizational
                                    restructuring and technological modernization are not enough to significantly change
                                    the
                                    functioning of public organizations. Thus, when realizing that investing in people
                                    working in the public sector is a process of results in the medium and long term,
                                    not
                                    always with visibility for society, many government officials have chosen in the
                                    course
                                    of history not to do so. According to Gaetani (1998), despite the reformist
                                    discourse
                                    claiming professionalization of public management, with changes in the recruitment
                                    and
                                    selection system, in job and salary policies, training and development, promotion
                                    and
                                    benefits, in the format of public tenders, etc., the concern paramount has always
                                    been
                                    to reduce payroll and downsizing.<br />
                                    The public service currently lives with both extremes in people management. In the
                                    same
                                    organization it is possible to find outdated processes and also modern people
                                    management
                                    practices. Araújo Júnior and Martins (2014) point out that in Brazil, for example,
                                    management by competences was consolidated as one of the models to be followed by
                                    the
                                    public administration, from Decree No. 5,707 of 2006. This aspect can be justified
                                    by
                                    the discontinuity of policies of people management in public administration and
                                    difficulties in structuring management systems. Therefore, the presence of various
                                    management models and traces of outdated models, may still exist in institutions
                                    today,
                                    when considering that the implementation of public administration models is not
                                    usually
                                    consolidated. (MATIAS-PEREIRA, 2007)<br />
                                    Skorková (2016) points out that managerial functions can be similar and generic
                                    between
                                    the public and private sectors, however the conditions in these two environments are
                                    quite different. In addition, even greater challenges are posed for the management
                                    of
                                    people in the public sector, when observing the context of the area, political
                                    instability, the turnover of top managers and the mutual existence of
                                    “patrimonialist”,
                                    bureaucratic, managerial and networked models. Discussing policies and practices and
                                    debating how public organizations have been organizing their people management is
                                    essential to contribute to society and to the daily practices and challenges that
                                    the
                                    area has been facing.

                                    The work is directly related to the construction of identity in its various levels
                                    of
                                    analysis, configuring itself as a source of pleasure and suffering for individuals,
                                    depending on the way they perceive and deal with it in their daily lives. Phenomena
                                    such
                                    as intensification, precariousness and individualization, which are increasing in
                                    various types of productive activities, have generated various impacts on workers,
                                    outlining other labor relations, both inside and outside the country. In Brazil,
                                    changes
                                    in labor and social security legislation and other legal apparatuses have also
                                    materialized in workers' loss of rights. Thus, work is a central element in people's
                                    lives, experienced in different ways from countless references. Unsurprisingly, the
                                    world of work is increasingly diverse in composition. The heterogeneity of the
                                    workforce
                                    presents broad fields of research for work, human behavior and people management,
                                    including studies that relate and intersect the age and/or generational factor with
                                    other constructs in social relations at work. A generation can be understood as a
                                    group
                                    that shares - beyond the period of birth and of near ages - significant historical,
                                    political and social events in their existence that can be associated with human
                                    development and the existence of some benchmarks. The literature points out that
                                    individuals of different age groups tend to behave in peculiar ways, demarcating
                                    different ways to enter, stay and/or leave the world of work, reflecting
                                    particularities
                                    in the behavior of young people, adults and the elderly in the workplace. Just as
                                    youths
                                    are diverse, the experiences of older people in retirement also mark experiences
                                    that
                                    need to be further investigated, understood and managed. Taking into account also
                                    other
                                    intersectionalities - such as gender, skin color, sexual orientation, religious
                                    orientation, aesthetic orientation - such particularities tend to increase and
                                    constitute complicating factors from the social point of view and thus management.
                                    Such
                                    issues certainly demand a more active role of organizations and people management,
                                    in
                                    the sense of greater participation and accountability regarding the challenges
                                    understood in the processes of insertion and exit from the labor market.<br />
                                    Therefore, this theme seeks to stimulate debates, research development and knowledge
                                    deepening regarding the age diversity of the workforce and multiple generations in
                                    the
                                    work environment, as well as discussions that relate such themes with:<br />

                                    Therefore, researches focusing on such groups, individually or comparatively, in the
                                    most different shades of the world of work, as well as with the most diverse
                                    epistemological and methodological contributions, are welcome.

                                    Undoubtedly, Brazilian society reproduces discriminatory traits and structures from
                                    the
                                    colonial-slavery period. Such social problems are perceived daily in the racial and
                                    class prejudices and discrimination, in the impoverishment, in the unequal
                                    distribution
                                    of opportunities (Fernandes, 2008). Once inserted in such a social reality,
                                    organizations and their corporate environment reinforced these problems, repeating
                                    stereotypes which have been harmful to the insertion and rise of minority groups
                                    (Paim &
                                    Pereira, 2018).<br />
                                    The coexistence of multiple identities in the social and organizational environments
                                    imposes challenges for the management and the understanding of the processes that
                                    involve diversity. We often observe critical ideologies of difference and feelings
                                    that
                                    culminate in the attribution of "cultural difference" or "functional" that exclude
                                    certain groups, depending on their gender, race, ethnicity, skin color, mental
                                    illness,
                                    culture, religion, age, aesthetics, disabilities (physical, mental, sensory,
                                    psychosocial, intellectual), affective-sexual orientations, country or region of
                                    origin,
                                    social class, profession or the hierarchical position in organizations. This
                                    exclusion
                                    is often manifested in acts of explicit or symbolic violence that cause suffering to
                                    these victims.<br />
                                    Driven by different perspectives, including decolonial and aphrodiasporic
                                    (Bernardino-Costa et al., 2018; Mignolo, 2020), academia has resisted through the
                                    recognition of voices, bodies and narratives of the growing and diverse population
                                    of
                                    historical victims that constitute alternative knowledge, economy and politics.
                                    <br />
                                    For this reason, the objective of this WG is to promote the debate about all forms
                                    of
                                    inequalities within labor relations and public policies for the different dimensions
                                    of
                                    diversity, as well as in a global political economy, and also for the recognition
                                    and
                                    analysis of “traces” left by the slavery period in management practices and
                                    organizations. We aim to address how political and practical measures can be
                                    designed in
                                    order to promote the inclusion of minority groups and marginalized voices, so that
                                    we
                                    work for social justice and the well-being of all individuals and communities. In
                                    this
                                    sense, we believe it is essential to recognize the darker side of the dynamics of
                                    exclusion/inclusion and to discuss in what extent public policies and existing
                                    initiatives for diversity management are aligned with the agendas of social
                                    movements
                                    (feminists, blacks, LGBTQIA +, anti-ableism, for instance) as well as to analyze how
                                    these public policies and initiatives of diversity management impact organizations
                                    and
                                    the functioning of collectives (affinity groups and employee resource groups).<br />
                                    In this WG, we accept empirical and theoretical works regardless their ontological
                                    premise and epistemological perspective. We are looking forward to receiving works
                                    that
                                    discuss how to deal with the challenges regarding the inclusion of minorities and
                                    minority groups, how to value diversity and how to promote social and/or
                                    organizational
                                    justice as well as works that identify new and emerging identities, demands and
                                    desires
                                    within the organizational and social contemporary context in the face of the
                                    challenges
                                    imposed by the (re)configuration of society caused by a strong neoconservative
                                    wave.<br />
                                    We believe that from this effort it will be possible to encourage the participation
                                    of
                                    academics, managers and professionals in a collective effort to discuss existing
                                    models
                                    and create new solutions, aligned with the reality of Brazilian society and focused
                                    on

                                    The proposal is to discuss the current situation of studies around the achievements
                                    and
                                    challenges experienced by women and men when equating career and personal life.
                                    Given
                                    that the gender issue makes light of this discussion, the working group also intends
                                    to
                                    widen the look at the intersectionalities that touch the woman and call the
                                    discussion
                                    the concepts of femininity and masculinity.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Therefore, the interest of this proposal is to bring together researches and
                                    practices,
                                    of a transdisciplinary nature, that problematize issues related to the work and the
                                    personal life of women as well as of men. It is hoped to bring together researchers
                                    that
                                    address these discussions with a focus on gender issues, taking into account old and
                                    current impasses and challenges.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Understanding gender as a two-part link allows us to reflect on the social puzzle
                                    that
                                    constructs positions and roles in which men as a universal category are seen with
                                    certain behaviors (Carmo, 2010) and women with behaviors generally opposed to men
                                    (Medrado & Lyra, 2008).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    When speaking of gender, it is common to refer to the feminine and the masculine.
                                    Unfortunately we have learned to act according to the prescriptions of each sex and
                                    we
                                    still find stereotyped patterns in which the feminine relates only to women and the
                                    masculine only to men.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    We can not forget the fluidity that exists when we talk about gender. For example,
                                    Souza
                                    et al (1985, p. 283) point out that "masculine has much more feminine content in the
                                    present day than in the past." It is in this context that we consider that the
                                    gender
                                    marker constitutes a category and also a relational term. What it is to be a man
                                    depends
                                    on what it is to be a woman and vice versa. Changes in females impact what becomes
                                    male
                                    (Nascimento et al, 2009; Araújo, 2005).<br />
                                    <br />
                                    In addition, other proposals that do not address the debate from the gender category
                                    but
                                    which contribute to discussions related to the labor market and career are also part
                                    of
                                    this discussion.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Therefore, it is expected that the work will be framed in the following
                                    topics:<br />
                                    <br />

                                    4. Dual career.<br />

                                    Based on Work, Organizations and Subjectivity, we aim to discuss the work and its
                                    articulations with the micro (subject) and macro (social) dynamics. In this sense,
                                    work
                                    can be understood as something beyond an occupation, that is, as an activity that
                                    plays
                                    a fundamental role in structuring the subject's identity, subjectivity and health
                                    and,
                                    at the same time, enable the construction of the social bond and its articulations
                                    with
                                    the real. In common sense, work is central to our lives and can also be seen as the
                                    society moderator because it considers ideological, sociological, psychological,
                                    political, legal and economic perspectives, it is important to highlight that work
                                    can
                                    have a positive or negative impact on people's lives. Likewise, it is necessary to
                                    consider that the current experience of working has driven the subject to precarious
                                    jobs, challenging the last breaths of the promises of achievement and emancipation
                                    through work.<br />

                                    It is undeniable the profound effect of the recent set of socioeconomic, cultural
                                    and
                                    individual changes on the traditional career model, usually portrayed as linear,
                                    stable,
                                    upward and full-time (Adamson, Doherty, & Viney, 1998). On the one hand,
                                    globalization,
                                    technological advances and increasing competitiveness have contributed to
                                    reconfigure
                                    the nature of work, with the emergence of alternative arrangements, including the
                                    gig
                                    economy; the increase in unemployment, underemployment and underutilization of
                                    labor;
                                    and the polarization and precariousness of work (Callanan, Perri, & Tomkowski,
                                    2017). On
                                    the other hand, the growing diversity of the workforce, associated with an expanding
                                    contextual differentiation process, contributes to the complexification of labor
                                    relations, which challenges our understanding of the interrelationships between
                                    career,
                                    individual, organization and society (Van Maanen, 2020).<br />
                                    The emergence of new career models since the 1990s, with emphasis on protean and
                                    boundaryless careers, is directly related to the overvaluation of the agency, at the
                                    expense of not recognizing the external conditions that impact professional
                                    trajectories
                                    (Mayrhofer, Myer, & Steyrer, 2007). Although over the past two decades, some efforts
                                    have been made to contemplate dimensions such as gender (Mainiero & Sullivan, 2005),
                                    there is a lack of research effort oriented to the theme of the exclusion of
                                    minority
                                    groups in the access to the most qualified occupations and jobs at the top of the
                                    professional hierarchy (Prasad & Prasad, 2007).<br />
                                    In that regard, there is a call for a career perspective that addresses – from a
                                    critical and non-homogenizing lens, unrestricted to professional and managerial
                                    careers,
                                    and intersectional whenever possible – the marginalization of traditional minority
                                    groups, associated with aspects such as social class, culture, ethnicity , gender,
                                    age,
                                    religiosity and sexuality (Pringle, Myers, Elley-Brown, & Reid, 2020).<br />

                                    Considered a central activity that structures the lives of individuals, work began
                                    to
                                    acquire different meanings even more in times of intensification of flexibility and
                                    outsourcing supported by the discourse of employability and management of one's own
                                    career (ROHN; LOPES, 2015). Therefore, the meaning of the work has been, repeatedly,
                                    an
                                    object of research.<br />
                                    <br />
                                    Research on the concept of meaning of work has encompassed a wide range of
                                    theoretical
                                    and methodological options. It is a central concept in emerging theories such as
                                    positive psychology (PRATT; ASHFORTH, 2003). However, the focus is mainly on the
                                    work
                                    space and the dynamics of its activities, although it is recognized that the
                                    meanings of
                                    work are connected with different dimensions of the social context.<br />

                                    More recently, the discussion on the topic also encompassed the new formats of work
                                    regulation, temporary contracts, flexible hours, reduced working hours and telework
                                    (RODRIGUES; BARRICHELLO; MORIN, 2016, RODRIGUES et al. 2017)<br />

                                    This track proposes to discuss work (im)mobility(s) experienced by people and
                                    organizations in contemporary society. This scenario is highlighted in the face of
                                    the
                                    COVID-19 pandemic.<br />
                                    We consider that we live in the era of mobilities (CRESSWELL, 2006; HAAS; CASTLES;
                                    MILLER, 2020; ELLIOT; URRY, 2010; FREITAS, 2009; RODRIGUEZ; MEARNS, 2012), although
                                    structures and contextual elements produce stratifications, as well as individual
                                    attributes limit or expand possibilities of being on the move. On the one hand,
                                    technology advances, time and space narrow, transport and communications are
                                    accelerated, allowing people and organizations to experience international mobility
                                    and
                                    cross geographical boundaries for business. On the other hand, global and local
                                    power
                                    disputes propel people to movements for survival or for work. Both streams promote
                                    cultural, economic, social, (re)modulating demographic interactions (BAUMAN, 1999;
                                    CHANLAT; DAVEL; DUPUIS, 2013).<br />
                                    The impact of technology on (im)mobilities has also been changing ways of working
                                    and
                                    elements that make up the life-work relationship. Home office, telework, and other
                                    organizational forms that make work relations more flexible have spread (HISLOP;
                                    AXTELL,
                                    2007). The bonds are increasingly fluid, involved in the coexistence between
                                    geographical immobility and digital mobility, as in the so-called digital nomads
                                    (AL-HADI; AL-AUFI, 2019).<br />
                                    In addition, it is necessary to emphasize the work-related social (im)mobility
                                    (CRESSWELL; DOROW; ROSEMAN, 2016). We consider that the possibility of social
                                    ascension
                                    made possible by higher education was observed in the Brazilian labor market,
                                    however,
                                    the reproduction of inequalities persists due to the differentiation between higher
                                    education available for popular access and the ones restricted to elites. In this
                                    sense,
                                    for those who are not in this last group, there is the decency due to unemployment,
                                    flexibility, and precariousness of work that require expressions of resistance and
                                    resilience, through new ways of working, creating, and (re)inventing.<br />
                                    While such contexts may be characterized as transformations of the world of work,
                                    the
                                    global Covid-19 pandemic has uncovered inequalities, facilities, difficulties, and
                                    challenges for individuals and organizations. The global health crisis has affected
                                    in
                                    an unprecedented way the ways of living and working and make us question whether the
                                    consequences will be as fleeting as their imperative, whether the choice to keep on
                                    the
                                    move or immovable will become an indicator of privilege or whether the effects of
                                    the
                                    pandemic period will leave deep and irreparable marks in the context of work now

                                    The transformations of work establish a direct relationship with organizational
                                    changes,
                                    challenging the regulation systems and labor relations in the contemporary context.
                                    Several analytical lenses make it possible to analyze them, from the polarization
                                    between wealth and misery at work to organizational alternatives, such as
                                    entrepreneurship, which are inserted in the current discussion of the (re)
                                    configurations of the labor market. There are also several challenges, both for the
                                    labor relations and the workforce management processes (selection, recruitment,
                                    careers,
                                    compensation, evaluation, and development). New skills and competencies are required
                                    and
                                    must be examined to analyze the extent of their impacts. Such issues demand a
                                    strategic,
                                    critical, and innovative vision of labor relations. It is necessary to examine the
                                    changes and permanences that are presented, the new models of management and
                                    organization, and the role of labor relations systems in social well-being and the
                                    civilizing process. Also relevant is the issue of labor and organization flexibility
                                    as
                                    a result of the introduction of new technologies, organizational innovations, and
                                    restructuring in industry, services, and commerce. These changes, manifested by the
                                    Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Industry 4.0 and new
                                    configurations expressed in the movements of uberization, gig economy, and “sharing”
                                    economy, bring new challenges to people and professions, putting in check the future
                                    of
                                    labor and the labor market. There is a need to rethink labor relations systems since
                                    more traditional models are no longer able to explain the complex contemporary
                                    dynamics,
                                    impacted by different phenomena, such as industry 4.0, the advancement of the
                                    computerization of HR practices, the movement of flexibility labor legislation in
                                    several countries. Approaches in the field of critical theory, such as labor process
                                    theory, as well as in the field of sociology of work, can be examined. The various
                                    facets of work transformations and their effects on labor relations have demanded
                                    that
                                    researches go beyond classical studies, such as those on working conditions,
                                    collective
                                    bargaining between unions and companies, flexibility, and (de) regulation. The
                                    classic
                                    themes remain current and necessary, but they must coexist with the emerging ones,

                                    to theoretical and empirical, qualitative, and quantitative studies. The future of

                                    will depend on the construction of new labor and union movements and also on the
                                    proposal of new institutions for protection and regulation of labor relations at the

                                    The study of consumer behavior covers all processes involved when people select,
                                    buy, use or have products, services, ideas and experiences to meet their needs and
                                    desires. The Consumer Behavior theme is always current, because as consumers, we are
                                    constantly exposed to new forms of consumption and we also influence companies'
                                    marketing strategies. With the development of new technologies, the diversification
                                    of digital channels and platforms, the number of factors that influence consumer
                                    decisions has grown substantially. Consequently, the demand for research that
                                    analyzes the antecedents and consequences of consumer behavior is enormous. The
                                    studies that involve this theme seek to analyze the factors that allow the
                                    understanding of consumers' buying behavior and its implications in the formulation
                                    of the company's strategy and also of public policies. Research on this topic also
                                    seeks to discuss the main perspectives of consumer analysis, involving
                                    socio-cultural aspects, individual differences and the stages of the purchasing
                                    decision process. Thus, this topic covers theoretical and empirical studies that
                                    result from surveys, correlational models and exploratory studies. It also includes
                                    studies that explore the individual determinants of consumer behavior. In addition,
                                    include, but are not limited to, studies on motivation, personality, attention,
                                    perception, search for information, purchase decision process, training and changing
                                    attitudes.

                                    Consumer Culture presents discussions aligned with the theoretical perspective of
                                    the Consumer Culture Theory (CCT). The focus of Culture and Consumption research is
                                    the investigation of the social conditions in which consumption and market resources
                                    (eg brands, channels, technologies, among others) directly or indirectly mediate
                                    social relations, the experiences of individuals, the symbolic and material
                                    cosntruction of social arrangements. Therefore, the theme includes studies or essays
                                    that seek to explore consumption - meanings, socio-materiality, influences,
                                    practices - from a multidisciplinary approach, articulating areas of knowledge such
                                    as Anthropology, Sociology, History, Linguistics and Social Communication. Research
                                    examples include investigations that seeks to understand consumption and issues
                                    related to gender, aesthetics, regionalities, construction and maintenance of social
                                    identity, cultural and social differences, urban tribes, different consumer groups,
                                    networks, anti-consumption and resistance. In this type of research, culture is not
                                    investigated as a variable or as a homogeneous system of collectively shared
                                    meanings, for example, explaining what would be Brazilian culture or the culture of
                                    an especific region of the country, such as Rio Grande do Sul, Rio de Janeiro, etc.
                                    Research from the theoretical perspective of CCT explores the heterogeneous
                                    distribution of meanings and the overlap of different coexisting cultural groups in
                                    complex societies.

                                    This theme aims to broaden the interconnection between the marketing field and the
                                    notion of the market. Prevalent in the marketing literature discussions until the
                                    1960s, this interconnection has come to the forefront face the contemporary
                                    recognition of the role that the market - its production and its dynamics - has in
                                    the marketing theorization and practice. Market construction field involves
                                    researchers initially connected with social and cultural perspective about
                                    consumption, industrial marketing, as well as economic sociology and economic
                                    anthropology. The ontological perspective that shapes market studies involves both
                                    structuralist conceptions of the market, practice and flat ontologies-such as the
                                    Actor-Network Theory. It includes studies or essays that take the 'market' as
                                    central element - indifferently of the theoretical and methodological perspectives.
                                    It involves studies connected with emerging market description perspectives, such as
                                    market constructivist studies, market practice, agency and market modeling, market
                                    system dynamic, among others. It involves also market studies from different levels
                                    of analysis (macro, meso and micro), notions of aggregate marketing systems,
                                    institutions and institutionalization process and the intersectionality involving
                                    market and society. Some examples of interest topics for this Working Group include,
                                    among others, description of dynamics that shape a specific market, new market
                                    building, alternative markets analysis, conflicts and the role of different agents
                                    in market constitution, market structure, regulation and institutionalization of
                                    markets, marketization process, cultural, sociological, historical and
                                    anthropological explanations for the markets.

                                    The theme Theory, Epistemology and Research Methods in Marketing is already offered
                                    as an option for submitting papers to EnANPAD for many years. One of its main
                                    contributions is to be an opportunity for the submission of articles that discuss
                                    and reflects at the same time the essence of the academic marketing area, as the
                                    proposals of new suggestions of theories, models and methodologies that should be
                                    explored by the marketing area in future articles. Studies that explore both the

                                    discussions about qualitative and quantitative methods in marketing. It includes
                                    studies that seek to understand the marketing phenomena associated with different
                                    global and Brazilian realities, integrating theoretical and methodological
                                    contributions from other management areas. Includes discussions of epistemological
                                    applied to the construction of Theories in Marketing. This is a theme that already
                                    exists in the marketing division and allows not only testing or proposing
                                    methodological and theoretical innovations and improvements, but also a reflection

                                    This research topic receives studies that consider marketing strategies and
                                    activities as inputs and marketing performance as the main output (s). Inputs are
                                    understood as the entire marketing effort of marketing strategies (product /
                                    service, price, place and promotion) and variable outputs of performance / response
                                    in consumer mindset levels (brand equity, perceived quality, satisfaction,
                                    attitudinal loyalty) , consumer behavioral (acquisition, retention, word of mouth,
                                    customer lifetime value, share of wallet), product-market (sales, market share,
                                    profitability) and accounting and financial (costs, profits, margins, leverage,
                                    return to investor). It also includes studies on concepts, models and theories about
                                    relationships between companies, customers and other parties involved in delivering
                                    value and generating performance. Also included in this thematic are researches that
                                    explore resource allocation, market analysis and international marketing strategy
                                    (export / import of products), but that necessarily relate these concepts to market
                                    performance metrics. The theme receives works from several methodological
                                    inspirations, such as survey research (methods supported by survey), experimental
                                    and econometric modeling applied to marketing data and several analytical techniques
                                    to understand the impact of marketing at firm, company (or retail), product-brand or
                                    consumer. Finally, it may also include systematic literature reviews (bibliometric
                                    reviews or meta-analytical studies) whose purpose is to explain the determinants of
                                    market performance variables at their different levels. Finally, it includes
                                    elements of the management of the marketing mix (products, prices and
                                    communication).

                                    The services science track focuses on explaining and driving systematic innovation
                                    and service management. Service systems are configurations of co-creating value of
                                    people, technology, value propositions connecting internal and external service
                                    systems and shared information (Maglio & Spohrer, 2008). This recursive definition
                                    of the service system seems necessary, since Service-Dominated Logic (LDS) was
                                    identified as an adequate philosophical basis for the development of a service
                                    science (Maglio, Vargo, Caswell & Spohrer, 2009; Vargo & Akaka, 2009) and service
                                    ecosystems are understood as fractal structures (Wieland, Hartmann, & Vargo, 2017).
                                    To break through and overcome conventional marketing thinking, we must interpret
                                    'service' as the application of skills for the benefit of the actors involved in an
                                    exchange, and recognize service as the fundamental basis of the exchange (Vargo &
                                    Lusch, 2009) and explain how these affect our well-being as individuals, employees,
                                    families and communities (Anderson & Ostrom, 2015). The use of a systemic
                                    perspective is natural and fruitful as we unravel the complexities inherent in the
                                    meaning of value, according to the perspectives of multiple beneficiaries, the
                                    processes of co-creation of value and the mechanisms for integrating resources in
                                    the ecosystems of services, coordinated by institutions and institutional
                                    arrangements (Ostrom, Parasuraman, Bowen, Patrício, Voss, 2015; Vargo and Lusch,
                                    2016). This framework also helps to model a new paradigm for marketing science, with
                                    interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary implications. Recent empirical and
                                    conceptual studies, mainly based on S-D logic, must be disseminated, discussed and
                                    evaluated on their potential to resolve lasting controversies and integrate
                                    knowledge from different sources in the field of service science.

                                    Brand Management has taken on special importance today. The value of brands and
                                    their addition to products and services, has increasingly stood out as a great
                                    generator of results for organizations. On the other hand, due to technological
                                    acceleration and virtualization of company-customer relations (whether through
                                    chatboots, robots and the use of artificial intelligence), brands have added greater
                                    importance as a result of interactions and experiences of consumers, considering the
                                    reduction of physical contact , being a strong identifier of a producer's purpose
                                    and identity. In this sense, brands linked to technology and big techs have grown in
                                    value to the detriment of traditional brands, and due to the exponentiation of
                                    growth caused by the network effect, new start ups have managed to occupy perceptual
                                    spaces and establish brands in shorter periods of time, suggesting challenges and
                                    opportunities for organizations. The relationship between Consumers and Brands
                                    (Consumer-Brand Relationships - CBR) is one of the themes of expression in
                                    contemporary marketing literature. The consumer-brand relationship can be defined as
                                    a logical extension of the brand personality, resembling the relationship between
                                    people. It results from an emotional bond resulting from the interactions and
                                    experiences of consumers with the brands, developed over time, leading firms to
                                    perform various tasks to build and maintain these relationships. In this sense, the
                                    consumer-brand relationship can be thought of as a result of the sequential
                                    interactive process of relationships between the consumer and a personified brand in
                                    a long-term perspective, instead of a simple repurchase pattern based on consumer
                                    satisfaction with a product, brand or service. In this relevant and fertile field,
                                    this theme was proposed.<br />
                                    In this sense, the proposed track incorporates the phenomena related to the
                                    following subthemes: Brands and brand management; Brand value based on the customer,
                                    Brand value for the company, Identity, Brand positioning and values, Brand elements;
                                    Marketing programs to build brand value; Integrated and digital communication to
                                    generate brand value; Branding strategies and brand architectures; Brand social
                                    responsibility, brand activism and curative marketing; Perspectives to study the
                                    relationship of the brand with the consumer (for example, self-connection with the
                                    brands, brand community, brand value / brand value, quality of the brand
                                    relationship); Brand relations; Models and variables used to explain and predict
                                    relationships between the consumer and the brand (for example, perceived ethics,
                                    brand authenticity, brand hypocrisy, value, satisfaction, commitment, trust,
                                    commitment and loyalty).

                                    The theme of "Marketing and Society" lies in the field of macromarketing, a field
                                    that is part of the noninteractive-non-economic perspective of marketing schools,
                                    which emerged from the 1960s onwards. Devotees to this field are dedicated to
                                    promoting a marketing systemic approach, to support strategies and policies for
                                    social well-being. In this sense, the main purpose of the topic is to discuss the
                                    numerous aspects related to the effects of marketing on society, analyzing both the
                                    positive aspects and the dysfunctions and problems inherent to this relationship.
                                    Therefore, studies that articulate ethics in marketing, sustainable consumption,
                                    collaborative consumption, resistance to consumption, consumerism, sustainability in
                                    marketing, subjective quality of life and personal well-being and marketing of
                                    non-profit organizations stand out. Studies that are based on the proposal of
                                    Transformative Consumer Research and Transformative Service Research, in which the
                                    figure of vulnerable consumers becomes central, are also welcome, and furthermore
                                    lead to the emergence of other issues such as hunger, obesity, food policy, food
                                    waste, food consumption and its socio-environmental impacts, citizenship and
                                    consumption, modern slavery, refugees, deviant paths of consumption, gender and
                                    intersectionality, narratives and stigmatization. Regarding the onto-epistemological
                                    choices, the various perspectives, as well as empirical and essayistic works are
                                    appropriate for the theme.<br />

                                    Consumption is often considered the dominant form of meaning production and
                                    reproduction in our society. As such, consumption opens possibilities for human
                                    interactions between people, objects and institutions. The importance of consumption
                                    in the investigation of themes related to social relations is undeniable and even
                                    inescapable. Given such importance, it is of utmost importance to recognize that if
                                    consumption opens doors and proposes relational possibilities, it also limits or
                                    even eliminates possibilities depending on which actors are involved in the
                                    consumption process. Going further, relations mediated by goods, services and
                                    experiences have both emancipatory and enslaving potential. Therefore, to look at
                                    consumption phenomena from a critical perspective is to shed light on the less
                                    visible side of consumption phenomena, those to which Nason (1989) referred to as
                                    unanticipated indirect effects (eg, discrimination, security threats, health,
                                    destruction of resources). The critical perspective allows us to account for power
                                    relations and domination between different actors in markets that, from a positive
                                    point of view, are naturalized, pass as invisible. We use the word "emancipation" to
                                    emphasize works that have as object these relations of imbalance, domination, or
                                    naturalization, and aim to produce knowledge that somehow leads to the liberation of
                                    the consumer of these forms of domain, either by proposing forms of social action
                                    that allow this emancipation of the consumer, either by describing them, analyzing
                                    them theoretically, or critically pointing their limits. Therefore, the following
                                    keywords are welcome on this topic: Critical marketing; Decoloniality and
                                    postcolonialism; Consumerism; Gender issues; Consciousness and consumption;

                                    development are welcome, since we see the conference sessions as opportunities to
                                    aid the development of the text. We also welcome cases that report unwanted effects

                                    The issue of consumer vulnerability has been recurrent in works in the marketing
                                    area. There are many factors that can lead an individual to the experience of
                                    vulnerability, so it is relevant to understand how consumers deal with this
                                    experience, in addition to understanding how marketing activities can affect the
                                    consumption decisions of individuals. Based on this knowledge, it is possible to
                                    expand the literature on the subject and present implications for public policies.
                                    Debt and lack of financial well-being are urgent issues, and understanding the
                                    dynamics of access to credit and generating insights to develop strategies that
                                    promote the financial well-being of the population becomes important.<br />
                                    In this perspective, the proposed theme expects to receive articles that explore
                                    different contexts of consumption that can lead an individual to the experience of
                                    vulnerability, as well as the coping strategies developed and used to minimize this
                                    experience. Work is also expected to investigate the financial decision-making
                                    process, considering both personal (personality traits) and market (credit access
                                    policies) aspects. Possible topics include (but are not restricted to):<br />
                                    • Background to financial well-being (objective and subjective variables);<br />
                                    • Financial decision-making process;<br />
                                    • Dimensions of financial well-being;<br />
                                    • How marketing activities can lead an individual to a situation of
                                    vulnerability;<br />

                                    The theme of public marketing, educational marketing and non-profit marketing has
                                    been gaining space in the marketing literature due to the growing importance of
                                    marketing in non-commercial sectors. In particular, social and educational
                                    organizations expand their importance to society and, at the same time, competition
                                    for resources, such as donors and volunteers, grows. Public marketing, on the other
                                    hand, has shown relevance to show society the effectiveness of government actions,
                                    which are increasingly demanded by citizens. In this way, researchers can contribute
                                    to public, educational and non-profit organizations, given that, generally, the
                                    direct import of marketing knowledge for profit for the public, educational and
                                    non-profit sectors tends to be inappropriate, requiring the construction of specific
                                    marketing knowledge for the public, educational and non-profit sectors. Therefore,
                                    this theme seeks to stimulate the interest of Brazilian researchers to investigate
                                    public marketing, educational marketing and non-profit marketing, as well as their
                                    derivations (health, politics, ecological, among others)

                                    Customer Centricity can be defined as the extent to which an organization is
                                    oriented to understand customers and deliver solutions indicated by them, thus
                                    implying a form of management oriented to understand what they want, how they want
                                    and how the company can organize to better meet those needs, get paid for it and
                                    still profit. In this sense, the true essence of the Customer Centricity paradigm
                                    lies in the ambidexterity of a company being able to create dual value for both the
                                    customer and the company itself.<br />
                                    Academic studies indicate that companies that generate superior results in relation
                                    to the average of their sector are oriented towards the market, improving knowledge
                                    about their customers and prospects, as well as placing them at the center of their
                                    strategy. Most notably, with the development of digital technologies, the concept of
                                    Customer Centricity has regained its importance, since this approach is expected to
                                    bring 30% or more ROI (return on investment) than the marketing approach that is not
                                    centered In the client.<br />
                                    Thus, also considering the need to better understand the journey of companies to
                                    become customer-centric, one of the gaps pointed out for the theme is the
                                    investigation of the antecedents of a customer-centric structure among companies
                                    that adopt this strategic design.<br />
                                    In view of this scientific opportunity, in the field of Marketing, this theme allows
                                    the realization of new theoretical and empirical studies, with qualitative and
                                    quantitative approaches, intertwining with discussions about user experience,
                                    consumption, hyper consumption, design thinking, shopping journey, brand experience,
                                    clienting, digital transformation, satisfaction and loyalty, personalization,
                                    challenges and consumer demands, omnichannel and superior performance.

                                    This theme includes discussions that aim to explain fashion as a behavior shared by
                                    a group in the same relationship of time and space as well as understanding luxury
                                    as a social construction not only of what is rare or exclusive but of what is not
                                    common or usual . The understanding of these phenomena has an important role both to
                                    collaborate with the theory of marketing of fashion and luxury as well as the
                                    strategic application for these sectors that due to their characteristics are not

                                    The themes ''place marketing'' and ''place branding'' stand out in the international
                                    contemporary marketing literature and relate to the management of market positioning
                                    based on tangible and intangible attributes and benefits of the brand of the place.
                                    This is specifically targeting both external audiences (for example, investors,
                                    tourists, expatriates, immigrants, students, researchers, among others) and internal
                                    audiences (for example, citizens, residents, government officials, marketing
                                    professionals, brand managers, government officials, and others).<br />
                                    We invite empirical studies on the branding of places that advance knowledge in the
                                    design of theoretical and methodological frameworks for the production of knowledge
                                    through academic inquiries as well as for directing consultancy projects and public
                                    policy. The proposed track addresses themes related to applicable classic brand
                                    theories on market repositioning or rebranding by differentiating places in the
                                    minds of target markets and other stakeholder groups. We welcome particularly
                                    manuscripts on the interrelationships between the development and sustainability of
                                    the place brand and its economic, social, political, technological, and/or cultural
                                    impact. Brand management plans can be analysed based on communicational competence,
                                    as communication is a key factor and a crucial prerequisite in place branding
                                    (identity, image, or reputation), including two main types: the primary channels
                                    (direct interaction via strategies, marketing projects on infrastructure,
                                    organizational-administrative structure, and behaviour/perception of stakeholders)
                                    and secondary channels (formal such as advertising, public relations, visual
                                    identity). Submissions about all understandings of types and scales of places are
                                    accepted, public or private, represented, for example, by a city, a region, a
                                    country, or its components: quarter, neighbourhood, square, park, university,
                                    museum, school, hospital, airport, bus station, shopping mall, public spaces etc.
